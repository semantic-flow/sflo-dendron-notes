Components with the **v-series component facet** have at least one historical checkpoint, i.e. at some point a [[sflo.concept.weave-process]] has generated a [[sflo.concept.mesh.resource.element.flow.snapshot.version]].


A [[sflo.concept.mesh.flow-facet.versioned]] collects [[Version|sflo.concept.mesh.resource.element.flow.snapshot.version]], so a v-series components must've had versioning turned on for at least one weave.
