Suppose DJ Radon wants to publish a website about himself, his musical activities, and maybe some album reviews. Call it a wiki, call it a knowledgebase, call it a homepage. 

To get started, he wants to publish his top-5 most-played cuts of the week. 

Publishing them as plain-text might be adequate for this situation, but say he eventually wanted to make his site linked: you can click from a playlist, to an album, to a track, to an artist. 

But to get started, :

* A **namespace** `/ns/`
* A **thing** `/ns/djradon/`
* A **dataset** `/ns/djradon/picks/`

#### Mesh Directory Structure

```file
/ns/
├── _id/
│   └── ns_id.trig
└── djradon/
    ├── _id/
    │   └── djradon_id.trig
    ├── _ref/
    │   └── djradon_ref.jsonld
    └── picks/
        ├── _id/
        │   └── picks_id.trig

        ├── picks.trig

        └── _v-series/
            ├── v1/
            │   └── picks_v1.trig
            └── v2/
                └── picks_v2.trig
```

#### Sample RDF (Turtle)

1. **Namespace metadata**

   ```turtle
   # /ns/_id/ns_id.trig
   <> a sf:Namespace ;
      dct:title "Namespace Root" ;
      sf:contains <https://example.org/ns/djradon/> .
   ```

2. **Thing metadata**

   ```turtle
   # /ns/djradon/_id/djradon_id.trig
   <> a sf:Thing ;
      rdfs:label "djradon" ;
      sf:backlink <https://example.org/ns/> .
   ```

3. **Dataset metadata**

   ```turtle
   # /ns/djradon/picks/_id/picks_id.trig
   <> a sf:VersionedDataset ;
      dct:title "djradon picks" ;
      sf:backlink <https://example.org/ns/djradon/> .
   ```

4. **Current distribution**

   ```turtle
   # /ns/djradon/picks/picks.trig
   <> dct:issued "2025-06-22"^^xsd:date ;
      dct:creator <https://example.org/agents/bot> .
   ```

5. **Historical version**

   ```turtle
   # /ns/djradon/picks/_v-series/v1/picks_v1.trig
   <> dct:issued "2025-06-01"^^xsd:date .
   ```

With these few rules and a tiny folder-walking parser your **Semantic Mesh** is unambiguously self-describing, easy to validate, and ready for any RDF-aware tooling.
