With two underscores, this is a sentinel file that:
- dictates whether a new version gets created on [[sflow.concept.weave]]
- can be placed directly in any [[sflow.concept.mesh.resource.node.dataset]] or [[sflow.concept.mesh.resource.element.reference-dataset]]

Content can be anything, but couldn't hurt for it to be descriptive, like "The presence of this file indicates that this dataset should not get any new versioned generated."
