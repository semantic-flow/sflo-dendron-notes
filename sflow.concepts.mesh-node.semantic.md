Semantic nodes are the main constituents of a [[sflow.concepts.semantic-mesh]]

The defining feature of a **semantic node** is that it has an associated [[sflow.concepts.element.catalog-dataset]]. It is a resource in the conventional RDF sense that it can be referred to in RDF data, i.e. as the subject or object of a triple.
