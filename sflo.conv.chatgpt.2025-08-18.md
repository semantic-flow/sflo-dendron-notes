I'm thinking about converting my Semantic Flow service (and its common files) to node.js (from Deno.) I'd like to take advantage of some of the RDF/JS ecosystem that depends on NodeJs streams (which in my understanding aren't available in Deno.) 

Should I start from scratch (after gathering learning from my initial implementation), or try to convert the existing code? 
ChatGPT said:

Short answer: don‚Äôt toss it. Do a staged migration and keep your domain code‚Äîonly swap the runtime-facing parts. A greenfield rewrite is worth it only if your current architecture is tightly coupled to Deno APIs and the codebase is small enough that you can re-earn correctness quickly.

Here‚Äôs a practical way to decide and proceed.
Should you rewrite?

Choose rewrite only if ‚â•2 of these are true:

    The codebase is small (< ~5‚Äì8 KLOC) or still prototype quality.

    Deno APIs are deeply woven through core logic (FS, net, permissions, timers, subprocess, path) with little separation.

    Your public API is still unstable, so breaking changes won‚Äôt hurt consumers.

    You want a different architecture (e.g., shift to ports/adapters, job queue, plugin system) that is easier to implement fresh.

Otherwise, migrate in place with adapters. Given your recent work (Weave, Semantic Flow, logging, CLI) and preference for careful versioning, you‚Äôll likely get a faster, safer result with an incremental conversion.
Recommended path (incremental ‚Äústrangler‚Äù)

    Split by layers (ports & adapters).

        Define narrow ‚Äúports‚Äù for the runtime-touching surfaces:

            Filesystem, path, globbing

            Process/CLI (args, env, exit, subprocess)

            Networking/server (HTTP)

            Streams (choose WHATWG streams internally)

            Logging & time

        Your existing ‚Äúmodule-level service injection‚Äù maps perfectly here: pass a RuntimeBundle (or compose a global default) and allow tests to inject a test bundle.

    Adopt WHATWG streams as the internal contract.

        Node has first-class WHATWG streams in node:stream/web, and you can adapt to classic Node streams via Readable.toWeb() / Readable.fromWeb().

        Many RDF/JS libs expose Node streams; keep adapters at the boundary so core logic stays portable.

    Create a new @sflo/core (runtime-agnostic) package.

        Move pure logic: RDF modeling, graph transforms, dataset/catalog resolution, path math, templating decisions.

        No Deno.*, no fs, no process. Just TS + interfaces.

    Add @sflo/runtime-node and (temporary) @sflo/runtime-deno.

        Implement your ports in each runtime.

        This lets you run the same tests against both backends until Node reaches feature parity.

        When Node is stable, retire the Deno runtime.

    Target Node LTS (ESM) and modern tooling.

        Node ‚â•20/22, ESM-only, "type": "module".

        Package exports map with types and ESM entry.

        Build with tsup or bunchee; test with vitest.

    Replace Deno-specifics incrementally.

        Deno.Command ‚Üí child_process.spawn (or zx if you like sugar).

        Deno.readFile/writeFile ‚Üí fs/promises.

        Deno.args ‚Üí a CLI lib (e.g., cac or commander).

        HTTP server: if you used Hono, use the Node adapter (@hono/node-server) and keep your routes unchanged.

    RDF/JS ecosystem integration (the reason you‚Äôre moving).

        Standardize on RDF/JS types (Quad, DatasetCore, Term).

        Add a streams adapter so you can plug in:

            N3.js parser/serializer (Node streams)

            rdf-ext dataset factories

            Comunica query engine (Node environment)

        Keep a single RdfBundle that exposes factories, parsers, serializers, and query.

    Test migration first, code second.

        Port your Deno tests to vitest while they still run on Deno via the deno runtime adapter (or run both test runners briefly).

        Goal: a stable test harness in Node that exercises the same core.

    CI & release.

        GH Actions: Node 20 & 22 matrix; build, test, typecheck, publish.

        If you still ship Deno for a bit, keep a separate job that runs Deno tests against @sflo/runtime-deno.

    Cutover plan.

    Tag the last Deno-only release.

    Ship Node runtime as beta behind a feature flag.

    When the Node path proves stable (your RDF/JS integrations pass), flip the default runtime to Node and mark Deno as deprecated.

Tiny code sketch (the shape)

// ports.ts (core)
export interface FS {
  readFile(path: string): Promise<Uint8Array>;
  writeFile(path: string, data: Uint8Array): Promise<void>;
  // ...
}
export interface Proc {
  exec(cmd: string, args: string[], opts?: ExecOpts): Promise<{ code: number; stdout: Uint8Array; stderr: Uint8Array }>;
}
export interface Streams {
  toWeb(readable: unknown): ReadableStream<Uint8Array>;
  fromWeb(stream: ReadableStream<Uint8Array>): unknown; // Node Readable
}
export interface RuntimeBundle { fs: FS; proc: Proc; streams: Streams; /* log, time, path, http */ }

// runtime-node/fs.ts
import { promises as fs } from "fs";
export const nodeFS: FS = {
  readFile: (p) => fs.readFile(p),
  writeFile: (p, d) => fs.writeFile(p, d),
};

// core usage
export async function loadCatalog(rt: RuntimeBundle, iri: string) {
  const p = iriToPath(iri);           // pure function
  const data = await rt.fs.readFile(p);
  return parseTrig(data);             // pure + RdfBundle
}

Why this beats a full rewrite

    You preserve correctness in the domain logic you‚Äôve been honing.

    You unlock RDF/JS immediately where needed by adding adapters.

    You can ship progressively (keep Deno consumers unbroken for a cycle).

    You end up with a clean architecture (ports/adapters) that will also make future browser/Bun/Deno targets trivial.

If your assessment still leans to greenfield, at least lift the domain code (parsers, IRIs, dataset series/versioning rules, catalog logic, logging contracts) and only re-author the runtime surfaces and the CLI. But given your setup and goals, I‚Äôd strongly recommend the incremental ‚Äústrangler‚Äù with a Node runtime package‚Äîfastest path to using Comunica/N3/rdf-ext without losing the work you‚Äôve already paid for.
You said:
I have 5k lines of code and it's mostly plumbing. The config file stuff is the only place where I'm actually touching on RDF (it's an RDF platform for managing datasets and minting IRIs) and I'm not totally happy with the half-assed ZOD approach. Thinking about using RDFine or LDKit instead. It currently uses Hono, so could consider a replacement framework. I'd need to replace the API documentation which uses Scalar's hono-based product, but was thinking of doing that anyhow... maybe using Hoppscotch or RapiDoc for a more "tinkerable" API experience.
ChatGPT said:

Given it‚Äôs ~5k LOC and ‚Äúmostly plumbing,‚Äù you‚Äôre in the sweet spot for an incremental port‚Äîkeep the good ideas, swap the runtime, and tighten your RDF story while you‚Äôre at it.

Here‚Äôs a concrete plan tailored to what you said.
1) Keep (for now) vs Replace

Keep (initially)

    Hono ‚Üí run it on Node with @hono/node-server. Your route handlers mostly survive unchanged, so you‚Äôre not spending time bike-shedding frameworks while you migrate the runtime.

    Internal stream contract ‚Üí use WHATWG streams internally and adapt at the edges:

        Node classic ‚Üî WHATWG: Readable.toWeb() / Readable.fromWeb().

Replace (incrementally)

    Deno APIs ‚Üí thin ports (fs, path, process, subprocess, http, streams), implemented once for Node.

    Zod-on-config ‚Üí move to an RDF-native validation/mapping flow (below).

    API docs UI ‚Üí serve a single openapi.json and mount multiple UIs (RapiDoc and Swagger UI). Keep Hoppscotch for ‚Äútinker‚Äù but as a client, not your docs generator.

2) RDF stack choice: RDFine vs LDKit (and friends)

Your needs: ‚ÄúRDF platform for managing datasets and minting IRIs,‚Äù light runtime mapping for config, and interoperability with RDF/JS + Node streams.

    RDFine (class mixins over RDF/JS terms)

        ‚úÖ Feels natural if you want typed model classes (Dataset, Catalog, Distribution, etc.) that still sit on rdf-ext datasets/quads.

        ‚úÖ Plays nicely with rdf-ext / N3 / Comunica.

        üîß You write shapes (SHACL) or constraints separately if you want validation.

    LDKit (type-safe Linked Data queries over SPARQL/Comunica)

        ‚úÖ Great when your config is fetched/sourced via SPARQL and you want TypeScript inference end-to-end.

        ‚úÖ Built to sit on Comunica (Node).

        ‚ö†Ô∏è Less of a ‚Äúclass model‚Äù vibe than RDFine; more query-centric. If your config is file-based Turtle/JSON-LD that you load and validate, RDFine + SHACL often feels simpler.

My recommendation for your case:

    Use RDFine for your domain model (DatasetSeries, Version, Distribution, Namespace, etc.).

    Use SHACL for validation with rdf-validate-shacl. Author shapes in RDF once; no dual-maintained TS schema.

    Use N3 for parsing/serializing; rdf-ext for factories/datasets; Comunica later for querying across multiple sources.

This replaces ‚Äúhalf-assed Zod‚Äù with first-class RDF validation and gives you typed TS classes for ergonomics.
Minimal flow for config

    Parse Turtle/JSON-LD ‚Üí rdf-ext Dataset.

    Validate with SHACL shapes ‚Üí errors surface as structured results.

    Wrap nodes in RDFine classes ‚Üí typed accessors & helpers.

3) Project split (ports & adapters)

packages/
  core/                # runtime-agnostic logic
    src/
      rdf/             # RDFine mixins, SHACL helpers, minting utils
      config/          # loadConfig(dataset), validateConfig(dataset, shapes)
      domain/          # dataset series/versioning rules
      http/            # route handlers as pure functions (RequestLike -> ResponseLike)
      ports.ts         # FS, Process, Streams, Clock, Logger, Path, HTTP
  runtime-node/
    src/
      fs.ts, path.ts, process.ts, streams.ts, http.ts  # adapters using node:*
      index.ts
  web-hono/            # thin app wrapper
    src/
      app.ts           # Hono app wiring; inject runtime-node into core handlers
      openapi.ts       # OpenAPI spec builder (openapi3-ts or typed routes)
      ui/              # RapiDoc index.html, Swagger UI assets

    core never imports node:* or Deno.*.

    web-hono is replaceable later (Fastify/Express) without touching core.

4) Concrete swaps and snippets
Streams boundary (Node ‚Üî WHATWG)

// runtime-node/streams.ts
import { Readable } from "node:stream";
import { ReadableStream as WebReadable } from "node:stream/web";

export const streams = {
  toWeb(readable: Readable): WebReadable {
    return Readable.toWeb(readable);
  },
  fromWeb(web: WebReadable): Readable {
    return Readable.fromWeb(web);
  },
};

RDF parsing & validation

// core/rdf/load.ts
import { DatasetCore } from "@rdfjs/types";
import { Parser as N3Parser } from "n3";
import rdf from "rdf-ext";

export async function parseTurtle(turtle: string): Promise<DatasetCore> {
  const parser = new N3Parser({ format: "text/turtle" });
  const quads = parser.parse(turtle);
  const ds = rdf.dataset();
  ds.addAll(quads);
  return ds;
}

// core/rdf/validate.ts
import rdf from "rdf-ext";
import { ShaclValidator } from "rdf-validate-shacl";

export async function validateWithShacl(data: any, shapes: any) {
  const validator = new ShaclValidator(shapes, { factory: rdf });
  const report = validator.validate(data);
  if (!report.conforms) {
    return report.results.map(r => ({
      path: r.path?.value,
      message: r.message?.map(m => m.value),
      focusNode: r.focusNode?.value,
      sourceShape: r.sourceShape?.value,
    }));
  }
  return [];
}

RDFine model (example)

// core/rdf/models.ts
import * as RDF from "@rdfjs/types";
import { RdfineFactory, createFactory } from "@tpluscode/rdfine";
import { schema } from "@tpluscode/rdf-ns-builders";

export interface DatasetSeries extends RDF.NamedNode {
  name?: string;
}

export function createRdfine(factory: RdfineFactory) {
  return {
    DatasetSeries: factory.createEntityMixin<DatasetSeries>((base) => class extends base {
      get name() { return this.getString(schema.name.value); }
    }),
  };
}

export const rdfine = createFactory();

Hono on Node (keep routes, change server)

// web-hono/app.ts
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { serve } from "@hono/node-server";
import { nodeRuntime } from "@sflo/runtime-node";
import { makeRoutes } from "@sflo/core/http/routes";

const app = new Hono();
makeRoutes(app, nodeRuntime); // inject runtime and handlers

serve({ fetch: app.fetch, port: 8787 });

5) API docs: generation + ‚Äútinkerable‚Äù UIs

    Generate openapi.json from code (choose one):

        Keep hono/openapi (or hono/zod-openapi if you still use zod at the HTTP edge), or

        Use openapi3-ts and build your spec in TS alongside route definitions.

    Serve multiple UIs off the same spec:

        /docs/rapi ‚Üí RapiDoc (fast, tinker-friendly).

        /docs/swagger ‚Üí Swagger UI (ubiquitous).

        (Optional) /docs/elements ‚Üí Stoplight Elements if you want a richer explorer.

        Hoppscotch remains your client playground; link to it with a preloaded collection if you like.

// web-hono/openapi.ts
import { OpenAPIObject } from "openapi3-ts";
export const openapi: OpenAPIObject = {
  openapi: "3.0.3",
  info: { title: "Semantic Flow API", version: "0.1.0" },
  paths: { /* ‚Ä¶ */ },
};

// mount UIs
app.get("/openapi.json", (c) => c.json(openapi));
app.get("/docs/rapi", (c) =>
  c.html(`<rapi-doc spec-url="/openapi.json"></rapi-doc>`)
);
app.get("/docs/swagger", (c) =>
  c.html(`
<div id="ui"></div>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/swagger-ui-dist/swagger-ui-bundle.js"></script>
<script>SwaggerUIBundle({ url:'/openapi.json', dom_id:'#ui' })</script>
`)
);

6) Minting IRIs & ‚Äúplumbing‚Äù cleanups

    Put IRI rules in core/rdf/minting.ts: pure functions that accept a config object (or RDFine class) and return IRIs. No FS/HTTP inside.

    Treat namespace/catalog/versioning as RDFine models + SHACL constraints:

        You can enforce ‚Äúdataset series must have exactly one current version‚Äù etc. in shapes.

    Keep file layout policies (where to write distributions, which filenames) in a PathPort adapter so filesystem/OS differences never leak into core.

7) Validation strategy comparison (why drop Zod here)

    Zod is great for JSON payloads at the HTTP edge. Keep it there if you want.

    Your config is RDF; validating JSON facades re-introduces drift. Prefer SHACL (or ShEx) as the single source of truth, then use RDFine for ergonomics.

8) Testing & CI

    Move tests to Vitest. Keep ‚Äúdomain tests‚Äù at core/ and run them without Node globals.

    Add a small integration suite that spins Hono on Node and exercises routes.

    Publish as ESM, Node 20/22. Use tsup to build, biome or eslint for linting.

TL;DR recommendations

    Incremental port; keep Hono for now via @hono/node-server.

    Adopt RDFine + SHACL for config (ditch Zod for that layer).

    Use rdf-ext + N3 + Comunica; adapt Node streams at the edges, WHATWG internally.

    Serve one openapi.json and mount RapiDoc + Swagger UI; use Hoppscotch as your client playground.

    Split ports/adapters so all ‚Äúplumbing‚Äù is isolated and future framework/runtime swaps are trivial.

If you want, I can sketch the exact interfaces for your RuntimeBundle and a minimal SHACL shape for your DatasetSeries/Version constraints next.

Claude suggests a fresh start, and suggtested some framework options that might be good for RDF platforms:

- __Fastify__ - Excellent TypeScript support, great plugin ecosystem

- __Express__ with TypeScript - Mature, tons of RDF middleware available

- __NestJS__ - If you want enterprise-grade structure with dependency injection

what RDDF middleware is available for any of these?
ChatGPT said:

Great question. Short version: Express has the most ‚Äúready-to-use‚Äù RDF middleware today; Fastify and NestJS don‚Äôt have much RDF-specific middleware, but they work well with the RDF/JS toolchain via adapters or providers.

Here‚Äôs the lay of the land:
Express (best current middleware coverage)

    @rdfjs/express-handler ‚Äì real middleware that parses incoming RDF (various content types) into req.dataset() / req.quadStream() and serializes RDF out via res.dataset() / res.quadStream(). This is the closest to ‚Äúplug-and-play RDF for HTTP.‚Äù
    GitHub

    rdf-express-node-factory ‚Äì middleware that decorates the request with a factory for creating NamedNodes relative to the request URL (handy for RESTful IRI minting).
    GitHub

    (Older/less maintained) http-rdf-formats-proxy ‚Äì Express middleware that fetches and converts RDF between formats; it‚Äôs deprecated but shows the pattern. Prefer rdf-parse/rdf-serialize directly today.
    npm

Libraries you‚Äôd commonly wire into Express middleware

    rdf-parse ‚Äì content-type aware RDF parsing to RDF/JS quad streams.
    npm

    rdf-serialize ‚Äì serializes RDF/JS quad streams to a negotiated syntax (Turtle, JSON-LD, TriG, ‚Ä¶).
    npm

    rdf-ext ‚Äì factories/datasets and lots of helpers around the RDF/JS interfaces.
    npm
    rdfjs.dev
    GitHub

    rdfxml-streaming-parser ‚Äì Node stream parser for RDF/XML if you need that syntax.
    npm

    Comunica ‚Äì SPARQL engine you can mount behind your routes (not ‚Äúmiddleware‚Äù per se, but a standard Node integration).
    rdfjs.dev

    Tip: Express‚Äôs built-in json() won‚Äôt parse application/ld+json. If you accept JSON-LD, handle it explicitly or rely on @rdfjs/express-handler / rdf-parse.
    GitHub

Fastify

    There‚Äôs no widely used RDF-specific Fastify plugin yet. The typical approach is:

        Use Fastify‚Äôs normal plugins for plumbing (routing, static, etc.), and

        In route handlers, use the same RDF/JS libraries as above (rdf-parse, rdf-serialize, rdf-ext, Comunica).
        Fastify‚Äôs plugin system makes it easy to wrap those as decorators if you want a ‚ÄúRDF toolkit‚Äù available on fastify.
        fastify.dev
        fastify.io

NestJS

    No official RDF module, but Nest works great with providers that wrap RDF/JS toolkits and interceptors/pipes for content negotiation and parsing. You‚Äôd typically expose a RdfService (factories, parsers, serializers, query engine) and inject it into controllers.
    NestJS Documentation

What I‚Äôd recommend for you (pragmatic)

    If you want middleware that just works today, Express + @rdfjs/express-handler is the smoothest path. You can still keep strong typing with TS and your ports/adapters approach.
    GitHub

    If you prefer Fastify for perf and plugin ergonomics, build a tiny plugin that exposes:

        rdf.parse(req) (via rdf-parse for Accept/Content-Type),

        reply.rdf(dataset|quadStream, { contentType }) (via rdf-serialize).
        It‚Äôs ~50 lines and keeps your app modern.
        npm+1

    For NestJS, make a RdfModule that provides RdfService (rdf-ext factory, comunica engine, parse/serialize helpers) and a ContentNegotiationInterceptor to set/treat RDF content types.
    NestJS Documentation

If you want, I can sketch:

    a minimal Express example using @rdfjs/express-handler to accept/emit Turtle & JSON-LD,

    or the Fastify decorator version (reply.rdf() & request.rdf()),
    so you can drop it straight into your codebase.

You said:
N3.js seems like an attractive library with streaming support, but I don't know if it supports json-ld. I think jsonld will be essential for me, so could tack on jsonld.js, but I think 
rdf-parse.js support jsonld and streaming. There was another library that claimed "10x faster", I can't remember which it was.
ChatGPT said:

You‚Äôre right to separate concerns here:

    N3.js does not parse JSON-LD. It targets Turtle/Trig/N-Triples/N-Quads (+ N3), with great streaming APIs. Use it for those syntaxes, not for JSON-LD.
    GitHub
    rdf.js.org

    rdf-parse does handle JSON-LD (and lots of other syntaxes) as streaming RDF/JS quads, and under the hood delegates JSON-LD to jsonld-streaming-parser. If you want one entry point that picks the right parser by Content-Type/extension, this is the ergonomic choice.
    npm

    jsonld-streaming-parser is a JSON-LD 1.1, RDFJS-friendly streaming parser (Transform stream). It supports the JSON-LD streaming profile and can parse from HTTP responses; the README also shows perf comparisons vs jsonld.js.
    GitHub

    The ‚Äú10√ó faster‚Äù you recall is likely graphy‚Äîa high-performance RDF toolkit that‚Äôs been reported (anecdotally) as significantly faster than N3 in some workloads. If raw parse/serialize speed is your bottleneck, it‚Äôs worth benchmarking in your context.
    Solid Community Forum

    For background: the JSON-LD Streaming note explains why typical JSON-LD processing isn‚Äôt inherently streaming, and how the ‚Äústreaming profile‚Äù enables it‚Äîuseful when deciding whether you can truly process JSON-LD as a stream end-to-end.
    W3C

A sane Node stack for you

    Parsing: rdf-parse at the boundary ‚Üí it yields a quad stream regardless of input type (Turtle, JSON-LD, RDF/XML, ‚Ä¶). JSON-LD is handled via jsonld-streaming-parser.
    npm

    Turtle/N-Quads fast path: if you know the format, call N3 directly.
    GitHub

    JSON-LD heavy: if you control producers and can emit the streaming profile, enable it in jsonld-streaming-parser for lower memory / earlier triples.
    GitHub

If you want, I can sketch a tiny adapter that: (1) inspects Content-Type, (2) runs rdf-parse (or N3 directly on known Turtle), and (3) gives you a WHATWG ReadableStream<Quad> you can feed into your pipeline.
You said:
we'll have to use file extension over content-type, because the focus of this platform is on file-based datasets served from github directly. 

I'm not familiar with WHATWG - which RDF libraries use that?
ChatGPT said:

Got it ‚Äî if you‚Äôre serving files from GitHub Pages / raw.githubusercontent.com, then yeah:
üëâ you can‚Äôt rely on Content-Type (they send text/plain), so file extension sniffing is the only reliable option.
1. WHATWG Streams vs Node streams

    WHATWG streams = the web standard streams API (ReadableStream, WritableStream, TransformStream).

        Built into browsers.

        Available in Node since v16 (stable in v18+ under node:stream/web).

        Interop with Node‚Äôs classic streams via Readable.toWeb() / Readable.fromWeb().

    Node classic streams = Readable / Writable / Transform from node:stream.

        Still the default in many older Node libraries.

        Pull/push model is slightly different; backpressure works differently.

üëâ In Node today, most RDF/JS tooling is still written against Node classic streams. Some newer libs are experimenting with WHATWG, but the RDF/JS spec itself is streaming by async iterators rather than WHATWG streams. That makes interop fairly straightforward.
2. Which RDF libraries use what?

    N3.js

        Uses Node classic streams (Readable / Transform).

        Example: parser.parse(readableStream) where readableStream is a Node stream.

    rdf-parse.js / rdf-serialize.js

        Also use Node classic streams, returning RDF/JS-compliant Stream<Quad>.

        These Stream objects implement both Node stream and async iterable interfaces.

    jsonld-streaming-parser

        Built as a Node Transform stream. So: Node classic.

    rdf-ext

        Wraps datasets/streams but mostly deals with RDF/JS async iterables.

    Comunica

        Internally uses async iterators everywhere (SPARQL results, bindings), not WHATWG.

        Input sources (quad streams) can come from Node streams or async iterators.

    graphy (the ‚Äú10√ó faster‚Äù one you remembered)

        Also built around Node classic streams.

üëâ So: if you want maximum ecosystem compatibility, stick to Node classic streams at the boundaries. Inside your core you can convert to WHATWG if you like ergonomic async iteration, since interop is one call away.
3. Practical adapter code

import { Readable } from "node:stream";
import { ReadableStream } from "node:stream/web";

// Node classic -> WHATWG
function toWeb(stream: Readable): ReadableStream<any> {
  return Readable.toWeb(stream);
}

// WHATWG -> Node classic
function fromWeb(stream: ReadableStream<any>): Readable {
  return Readable.fromWeb(stream);
}

4. For your platform

Since you‚Äôre file-based (GitHub Pages):

    Build a lookup table: extension ‚Üí RDF parser (via rdf-parse or direct N3).
    Example: .ttl ‚Üí N3.Parser, .jsonld ‚Üí jsonld-streaming-parser.

    Use Node classic streams at the boundary (fits all these libs).

    Internally you can consume as async iterables (ergonomic, testable).

‚úÖ Answer to your core question:

    No RDF library I know of is natively using WHATWG streams as its main API today.

    All major RDF/JS libs (N3.js, rdf-parse, jsonld-streaming-parser, graphy, Comunica) are built around Node classic streams (with async iterable support in some cases).

    Node‚Äôs built-in toWeb/fromWeb makes it trivial to normalize if you prefer WHATWG internally.

Do you want me to sketch a little ‚Äúextension-based RDF loader‚Äù function for you ‚Äî e.g. loadDatasetFromFile(path) that picks the right parser based on .ttl / .jsonld / .nq and returns an async iterable of quads? That‚Äôs the piece you‚Äôll definitely need for a GitHub-served dataset platform.
You said:
Here's Claude's stack proposal:

Core Platform:
  Runtime: Node.js with TypeScript

That stack is solid. Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôd tune it for your file-based, GitHub-served RDF datasets and streaming needs‚Äîplus a few ‚Äúgotchas‚Äù to avoid.
Quick verdicts & tweaks

Runtime & framework

    Fastify ‚úÖ great choice. You won‚Äôt find much RDF-specific middleware anywhere, so plan to wire RDF/JS libs yourself. Add a tiny Fastify plugin that exposes request.rdf() and reply.rdf() (see below).

    Express only if you want @rdfjs/express-handler out of the box. Otherwise Fastify wins on DX/perf.

RDF layer

    Pick RDFine + SHACL if your config is file-centric and modeled as resources (typed classes + true RDF validation).

    Pick LDKit if you‚Äôll query via SPARQL/Comunica and want typed query results end-to-end.

    Either way, standardize on rdf-ext factories/datasets, N3 (Turtle/Trig/N-Quads), jsonld-streaming-parser (JSON-LD), and/or a single rdf-parse entry point (you‚Äôll map by file extension, not content-type).

Quadstore

    Keep it. Wrap it behind a small GraphStore port so you can swap later (e.g., to Comunica sources or a hybrid).

API docs

    @fastify/swagger to serve OpenAPI 3; mount RapiDoc as primary explorer and Swagger UI as a fallback.

    If you go Express, consider openapi3-ts to hand-craft the spec near your route definitions.

Testing

    Prefer Vitest over Jest if you‚Äôre ESM-first; it‚Äôs faster and TS-native.

    For HTTP, Fastify gives you light-my-request built-in (no need for Supertest).

    Add a few golden-file parser tests per syntax (.ttl, .trig, .jsonld, .nq) so streaming regressions are obvious.

Configuration

    RDF config + SHACL shapes for validation (single source of truth).

    Generate TS helpers/types from RDFine (class mixins) or LDKit schemas; avoid node-config unless you only need env/app toggles.

Minimal Fastify ‚ÄúRDF plugin‚Äù (extension-based)

// rdf-plugin.ts
import fp from "fastify-plugin";
import { extname } from "node:path";
import rdf from "rdf-ext";
import { Parser as N3Parser } from "n3";
import JsonLdParser from "jsonld-streaming-parser";
import { Readable } from "node:stream";

function parseByExt(filename: string, input: Readable) {
  const ext = extname(filename).toLowerCase();
  if (ext === ".ttl" || ext === ".trig" || ext === ".nq" || ext === ".nt") {
    const parser = new N3Parser(); // auto-detects ttl/trig/nt/nq by content
    const ds = rdf.dataset();
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      input.on("error", reject);
      parser.parse(input, (error, quad, prefixes) => {
        if (error) return reject(error);
        if (quad) ds.add(quad);
        else resolve(ds); // end
      });
    });
  }
  if (ext === ".jsonld") {
    const parser = new JsonLdParser();
    const ds = rdf.dataset();
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      input.pipe(parser)
        .on("data", (q) => ds.add(q))
        .on("error", reject)
        .on("end", () => resolve(ds));
    });
  }
  throw new Error(`Unsupported RDF extension: ${ext}`);
}

export default fp(async (app) => {
  app.decorateRequest("rdf", null);
  app.decorateReply("rdf", null);

  app.addHook("preHandler", async (req) => {
    req.rdf = async (filename: string) => {
      const nodeReadable = Readable.from(req.raw); // body as stream
      return parseByExt(filename, nodeReadable);
    };
  });

  app.decorateReply("rdf", function (dataset, contentType = "text/turtle") {
    // serialize as needed; for brevity, Turtle only via N3.Writer:
    const { Writer } = await import("n3");
    const writer = new Writer({ format: "text/turtle" });
    for (const q of dataset) writer.addQuad(q);
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      writer.end((err, ttl) => {
        if (err) return reject(err);
        this.header("content-type", contentType);
        resolve(this.send(ttl));
      });
    });
  });
});

declare module "fastify" {
  interface FastifyRequest {
    rdf?: (filenameHint: string) => Promise<import("rdf-ext").DatasetCore>;
  }
  interface FastifyReply {
    rdf?: (dataset: any, contentType?: string) => Promise<any>;
  }
}

Usage:

import Fastify from "fastify";
import rdfPlugin from "./rdf-plugin";

const app = Fastify();
await app.register(rdfPlugin);

app.post("/ingest/:file", async (req, reply) => {
  const ds = await req.rdf!(req.params.file); // e.g., "thing.jsonld" or "data.ttl"
  // ...validate with SHACL, persist in Quadstore, mint IRIs...
  return reply.rdf!(ds); // echo back as Turtle
});

RDFine + SHACL: suggested shape

    Model your config classes with RDFine (e.g., DatasetSeries, Version, Distribution mixins).

    Validate invariants with SHACL, e.g. ‚Äúexactly one current version,‚Äù ‚ÄúIRI base required,‚Äù etc. Keep shapes versioned alongside your ontology.

Example constraints to start:

    :DatasetSeries sh:minCount 1 ; sh:path :hasCurrent ; sh:maxCount 1 .

    :Version sh:property [ sh:path :versionNumber ; sh:datatype xsd:integer ; sh:minCount 1 ] .

Small adjustments to Claude‚Äôs list

    Testing: swap Jest ‚Üí Vitest (unless you have legacy Jest plugins you need). For Fastify, prefer light-my-request over Supertest.

    Docs generation: stick with @fastify/swagger; add a /docs/rapi route that serves RapiDoc against /openapi.json.

    RDF types: if you don‚Äôt need SPARQL-first ergonomics, RDFine will feel more natural for ‚Äúfile in ‚Üí dataset ‚Üí objects ‚Üí rules ‚Üí out.‚Äù

    Runtime config: keep minimal env toggles in plain env/JSON; treat the real platform config as RDF + SHACL.

If you want, I can outline:

    a starter folder layout (core vs runtime vs web),

    a SHACL validation helper you can drop into the Fastify route,

    or a tiny OpenAPI spec that matches the /ingest/:file example above.

As a SPARQL gui, Comunica seems a little lacking compared to sparql-editor or even YASGUI, but it supports some interesting tech like https://github.com/rubensworks/GraphQL-LD.js
ChatGPT said:

Yeah‚ÄîComunica‚Äôs great as an engine, but it‚Äôs not meant to be a polished GUI. The usual pattern is:

    Expose a SPARQL endpoint with Comunica, then

    Embed a real editor UI (YASGUI or a wrapper) in your app.

Here are good, actively maintained options and how they fit:
Best-in-class GUI to embed

    YASGUI (YASQE + YASR) ‚Äì battle-tested, easily embedded, tons of config (saved queries, links, result renderers). Triply‚Äôs docs show the API and how to wire it.
    docs.triply.cc+1
    semantic-web-journal.net

    SIB Swiss sparql-editor ‚Äì a web component built on YASGUI with context-aware autocomplete across classes and predicates; drop it in with an endpoint URL. Handy if you want YASGUI without doing your own bootstrap.
    GitHub
    sib-swiss.github.io

Engine / endpoint layer

    Comunica SPARQL ‚Äì run a SPARQL endpoint over local files (great for GitHub-served datasets) or remote sources. comunica-sparql-http (web) and comunica-sparql-file-http (files) are the quickest way to stand something up; you can also embed the JS API.
    comunica.dev+1

GraphQL on top of RDF (dev-friendly)

    GraphQL-LD ‚Äì lets you query Linked Data using GraphQL + a JSON-LD context; executes via Comunica under the hood. Nice complement to a SPARQL GUI for folks who don‚Äôt want to write SPARQL.
    GitHub+1

Recommended setup for Semantic Flow

    Endpoint

        If your data is file-based: run Comunica SPARQL (file mode) in your Node service and mount it at /sparql.
        comunica.dev

    GUI

        Serve YASGUI at /play (or use sparql-editor web component) pointing to /sparql. Preload a few example queries and namespaces for your vocab.
        docs.triply.cc
        GitHub

    Optional developer UX

        Add /graphql-ld with GraphQL-LD as a second ‚Äúquery console‚Äù tab for GraphQL-style querying (ship a JSON-LD context that matches your ontology).
        GitHub

That combo gives you: serious SPARQL features (YASGUI), a fast flexible engine (Comunica), and a friendlier on-ramp (GraphQL-LD).
You said:
Is there any way to use jsonld for the API? openapi3-ts probably doesn't support jsonld? Is any working on linked-data APIs, aside from GraphQL-LD? 

Stoplight elements seems cool.

Is it weird to do an API-based service support both a CLI and a web client that primarily are doing local file manipulation?
ChatGPT said:

Great Q‚Äîthere are a few layers here. Quick answers first, details and options right after.

    Can you ‚Äúuse JSON-LD for the API‚Äù? Yes. Just return application/ld+json and (optionally) a profile= parameter. OpenAPI 3.x can describe any media type, so you can document JSON-LD payloads in your spec. What OpenAPI doesn‚Äôt do is understand RDF semantics‚Äîits schemas are JSON-Schema, not RDF.
    OpenAPI Initiative Publications

    Linked-data API work beyond GraphQL-LD? Yes: Hydra (JSON-LD vocabulary for hypermedia APIs), Linked Data Platform (LDP), SPARQL Graph Store HTTP Protocol, Linked Data Fragments (TPF/QPF), and production frameworks like API Platform that emit Hydra + OpenAPI.
    Hydra CG
    W3C+1
    Linked Data Fragments
    API Platform

    Stoplight Elements? Good choice; it‚Äôs an embeddable docs UI that reads OpenAPI (works fine even if your media type is application/ld+json).
    Stoplight
    GitHub

    CLI + web client doing mostly local file work‚Äî‚Äúweird‚Äù? Not at all. That‚Äôs standard local-first design: keep data/actions local, and use the API for validation, policy, indexing, or publishing. Browsers can even touch local files via the File System Access API (Chromium family; spotty on Firefox), or you can run a small local daemon for the web UI to talk to.

Practical ways to mix JSON-LD with OpenAPI

    Document JSON-LD directly in OAS 3.1

    requestBody:
      content:
        application/ld+json:
          schema: { type: object }   # JSON-Schema for the surface shape
    responses:
      '200':
        content:
          application/ld+json:
            schema: { type: object }

    This is fully valid OAS; the spec lets you name any media type in content:. You won‚Äôt get RDF-level validation, but your docs/testing tools will work.
    OpenAPI Initiative Publications

    Advertise profiles/contexts

        At HTTP level, use the profile parameter on application/ld+json (e.g., streaming, framing, or your API profile).
        IANA
        W3C

        In OpenAPI, include the Content-Type with the parameter in examples and response headers, or add a vendor extension like x-jsonld-context‚Äîtools won‚Äôt ‚Äúreason‚Äù over it, but humans will see it. (This is a known limitation; people use extensions for semantics.)
        GitHub

    Run dual docs: OpenAPI for humans, Hydra for machines

        Keep your OAS for Elements/RapiDoc/Swagger UI.

        Serve a Hydra API Documentation resource (JSON-LD) at a well-known URL so generic clients can discover operations. There‚Äôs even hydra-box (Express middleware) to wire a Hydra-described API.
        Hydra CG
        npm

‚ÄúLinked-data API‚Äù options to consider (beyond GraphQL-LD)

    Hydra (JSON-LD hypermedia vocab): machine-discoverable operations, collections, etc. Active W3C CG.
    Hydra CG
    W3C

    LDP (Linked Data Platform): HTTP CRUD conventions for RDF resources/containers. Solid builds on this.
    W3C
    solidproject.org

    SPARQL Graph Store HTTP Protocol: pure HTTP for creating/replacing/adding to named graphs‚Äîsimple, standardized graph CRUD.
    W3C+1

    Linked Data Fragments (TPF/QPF): shift query cost to clients; very cache-friendly for public, file-served datasets.
    Linked Data Fragments+1

    API Platform (ecosystem): emits JSON-LD + Hydra and OpenAPI side-by-side‚Äîgood reference if you want both worlds.
    API Platform+1

Suggested setup for your stack

    Keep OpenAPI 3.1 for DX; serve application/ld+json in content:; mount Stoplight Elements and RapiDoc.
    Stoplight
    docs.stoplight.io

    Provide Hydra docs at /api (or similar) so RDF-aware clients can navigate without bespoke code; consider hydra-box if you‚Äôre on Express for that piece.
    npm

    Use SHACL for true RDF validation (orthogonal to OpenAPI).

    Local-first clients:

        CLI: reads/writes local repos; calls your API for minting rules/SHACL checks.

        Web app: use File System Access API when available, fallback to upload/download flows elsewhere.
        MDN Web Docs
        Chrome for Developers

If you want, I can sketch a tiny OpenAPI snippet that shows a JSON-LD response plus an example Content-Type: application/ld+json;profile=..., and a matching Hydra API doc stub you can serve alongside it.
You said:
Internally, the following fully spec-compliant parsers are used by rdf-parse.js:

    N3.js
    jsonld-streaming-parser.js
    microdata-rdf-streaming-parser.js
    rdfa-streaming-parser.js
    rdfxml-streaming-parser.js
    shaclcjs

So probably best to just use rdf-parse.js for everything?

Keeping in mind that I don't have any existing users I need to support, and everything we've discussed, is it better to start fresh?

ChatGPT said:

Short answer:
Yes‚Äîuse rdf-parse as your default front door (it auto-picks the right parser by content-type or file name and gives you a streaming RDF/JS quad stream). Keep N3/jsonld parsers for special cases or perf tuning. And given you have no external users and want to rethink config (RDFine/LDKit + SHACL) and the HTTP layer, a fresh start is justified‚Äîwith targeted ‚Äúcode harvesting‚Äù from your old repo.
Why rdf-parse as the default

    It supports all the formats you listed (Turtle/Trig/N-Triples/N-Quads, JSON-LD, RDF/XML, RDFa, Microdata, SHACL-C) and can detect by file name (extension) when Content-Type is useless (e.g., GitHub raw).
    GitHub

    Internally it already uses the best-in-class streaming parsers (N3, jsonld-streaming-parser, RDFa/Microdata/XML, SHACLc), so you don‚Äôt have to wire each one.
    GitHub

    If/when you need a format-specific fast path, you can call N3 or jsonld-streaming-parser directly; otherwise the single entry point keeps your code small.
    GitHub

Minimal extension-based parse (Node):

import { createReadStream } from "node:fs";
import { rdfParser } from "rdf-parse";
import rdf from "rdf-ext";

export async function loadDatasetFromFile(path: string, baseIRI: string) {
  const inStream = createReadStream(path);
  const ds = rdf.dataset();

  await new Promise<void>((resolve, reject) => {
    rdfParser.parse(inStream, { path, baseIRI })
      .on("data", (q) => ds.add(q))
      .on("error", reject)
      .on("end", resolve);
  });

  return ds;
}

{ path } lets rdf-parse infer the format from the extension (e.g., .ttl, .jsonld, .nq, .rdf).
GitHub
Fresh start vs convert

Given:

    ~5k LOC that‚Äôs ‚Äúmostly plumbing,‚Äù

    you want to swap Deno‚ÜíNode, change config strategy (RDFine/LDKit + SHACL), rethink the API docs UI, and

    you have no external compatibility constraints,

‚Üí Start fresh with a clean architecture, and harvest proven utilities/tests from the old repo as you go. This avoids dragging Deno-era patterns along, and lets you center everything on RDF/JS + streaming from day one.
Greenfield skeleton (pragmatic)

    packages/core (runtime-agnostic)

        RDF models: RDFine mixins (or LDKit schemas)

        Validation: SHACL via rdf-validate-shacl

        IRI minting & dataset/versioning rules (pure functions)

    packages/store

        Quadstore adapter (your read/write/query API)

    apps/api (Fastify)

        Tiny ‚ÄúRDF‚Äù plugin exposing parseByPath() (wrapper around rdf-parse)

        Routes call core functions; content negotiation for application/ld+json and Turtle

        OpenAPI 3.1 spec + RapiDoc / Stoplight Elements UIs

    apps/cli

        Uses the same core + store to manipulate local files/repos

(If you‚Äôd rather keep Express for middleware availability, swap Fastify here; core stays the same.)
Config path

    Use RDF config files (Turtle or JSON-LD), validated by SHACL (single source of truth).

    Wrap config nodes with RDFine for ergonomic TS getters/setters.
    (LDKit is great if you‚Äôll query via SPARQL/Comunica a lot; for file-centric configs, RDFine + SHACL is usually simpler.)

rdf-validate-shacl is maintained and TS-typed; that lets you surface precise constraint errors.
npm+1
API flavor

    Keep OpenAPI for human-facing docs/tools (Elements/RapiDoc), even if your bodies are application/ld+json‚ÄîOAS supports any media type in content. Pair it with SHACL for RDF-level validation logic.
    GitHub

    If you want machine-discoverable hypermedia, add a Hydra doc endpoint alongside OpenAPI later.

TL;DR

    Yes: make rdf-parse your default parser (extension-based detection fits your GitHub-served files perfectly).
    GitHub

    Yes: with no users and multiple foundational changes, a fresh start (with selective code/test harvesting) will get you a cleaner, more RDF-native platform faster than retrofitting the old codebase.

    Core stack to anchor on: Fastify, rdf-parse + rdf-ext, RDFine (or LDKit), SHACL, Quadstore, OpenAPI 3.1 with RapiDoc/Stoplight.

If you want, I can sketch the Fastify ‚ÄúRDF plugin‚Äù wrapper around rdf-parse and a tiny SHACL shape for your DatasetSeries/Version invariants so you can drop them straight in.
You said:
should I use a new repo, or just a new branch?
ChatGPT said:

Go with a new repo.
Why a new repo fits your case

    You‚Äôre doing a greenfield Node rewrite (runtime, build, deps, testing, docs, config strategy) with no users to preserve‚Äîclean history beats giant migration diffs.

    Lets you run both codebases in parallel briefly (Deno legacy vs Node v2) without CI/CD confusion.

    Clearer versioning & packaging (fresh package.json, npm scope, release tags) and easier to publish multiple packages (@sflo/core, @sflo/runtime-node, @sflo/store, @sflo/cli, @sflo/api).

    Avoids dragging Deno-era patterns into the new architecture; you can selectively harvest utilities/tests.

Keep continuity (lightweight)

    In the new repo, add the old one as a remote and pull in the Deno tree into a legacy/deno/ folder (or keep a legacy branch) so you still have code to reference.

    Tag the old repo deno-legacy and archive it with a README pointer to the new repo.

When a branch would make sense (not your situation)

    If you had live users, stable package names, and wanted a short, reviewable diff to merge back into main. That‚Äôs not the case here.

Suggested structure for the new repo (monorepo)

semantic-flow/
  packages/
    core/            # RDFine (or LDKit), SHACL, IRI minting, rules ‚Äî pure TS
    runtime-node/    # fs/path/process/streams adapters; rdf-parse wrapper
    store/           # Quadstore adapter
  apps/
    api/             # Fastify server, OpenAPI, RapiDoc/Elements
    cli/             # Local-first ops; uses core + store
  docs/              # Developer docs & API docs site

Practical move plan (1‚Äì2 hours)

    Create new repo; set Node 20/22, ESM-only, tsup/bunchee, vitest.

    Copy over just the domain utilities and tests you still want (harvested, not wholesale).

    Stand up the rdf-parse based loader + SHACL validation path.

    Mount Fastify with RapiDoc and (optionally) Stoplight Elements off /openapi.json.

    Update the old repo‚Äôs README: ‚ÄúNew home ‚Üí <new repo>‚Äù; archive.

If you later decide to unify everything, you can always import the new repo as a subtree into a bigger monorepo‚Äîbut starting clean now will speed you up and keep your architecture crisp.
You said:
Instead of Comunica SPARQL I was just thinking of using Quadstore's SPARQL functionality. But running a SPARQL endpoint over local files sounds nice. Does Communica have to load the load files first though? 
ChatGPT said:

Short answer:

    Quadstore SPARQL is great if you want an indexed, updatable store you control in-process. It actually uses a Comunica-based engine under the hood (quadstore-comunica).
    npm
    GitHub

    Comunica SPARQL over files runs an HTTP endpoint directly on RDF files (no DB ingest). It parses/streams the files at query time; there‚Äôs no pre-loading into a database by default. For local files, use the ‚Äúfile‚Äù variant.
    Comunica+1

Does Comunica need to ‚Äúload‚Äù files first?

No database load step. You point the endpoint at one or more files and Comunica treats them as sources; it parses them when queries run (streaming parsers behind the scenes). You can stand this up with:

npm i -g @comunica/query-sparql-file
comunica-sparql-file-http path/to/data.ttl

Now you‚Äôve got a SPARQL endpoint over that file.
Comunica
When to prefer each

    Quadstore + quadstore-comunica: repeated queries, SPARQL Update, better pattern lookups/indexes, programmatic control.
    npm

    Comunica over files: quick, read-mostly endpoints over GitHub-served datasets or local folders‚Äîno ingestion step, simple to host. (Comunica also supports HDT sources for faster reads if you preconvert).
    Comunica

If you want one endpoint either way, you can:

    mount Comunica over files for ‚Äúbrowse/play‚Äù, and

    expose Quadstore SPARQL for your app‚Äôs writes/queries.

That gives you the nice ‚Äúfile endpoint‚Äù DX without giving up the store you already like.
You said:
How does security work with SPARQL? Does comunica or quadstore support authentication? I didn't really considered auth in my Deno prototype, but the app should know who is using it for provenance purposes at least, and we might want to control access, especially for applications using the service.

Speaking of the service, I was imagining the CLI using the API the same way a web client would. Does that make sense even if its local?

ChatGPT said:

Great questions‚Äîsecurity for SPARQL is mostly about the HTTP layer you put around your engine.
How auth ‚Äúfits‚Äù with SPARQL

    The SPARQL Protocol itself doesn‚Äôt define authentication; it rides over HTTP. You add auth (Basic, OAuth2/OIDC, mTLS, etc.) at the HTTP layer and then authorize what a user can query/update.
    W3C+1

What Comunica and Quadstore do (and don‚Äôt) give you

    Comunica (as an engine) can authenticate to data sources (e.g., HTTP Basic, Solid OIDC) when it fetches protected documents. That‚Äôs for upstream access. If you expose a SPARQL endpoint with Comunica, you typically front it with your web framework or a reverse proxy for user auth. You can also set timeouts via query context to control cost.
    Comunica+1
    GitHub

    Quadstore is an in-process JS store. It doesn‚Äôt do end-user auth; you enforce auth/ACLs in your service. SPARQL in Quadstore runs via quadstore-comunica (a Comunica-based engine).
    GitHub
    npm

If you want ‚ÄúSPARQL over files‚Äù

    Comunica SPARQL (file) serves an HTTP endpoint directly over local/remote RDF files‚Äîno DB ingest. It parses at query time. Wrap that endpoint with your framework (Fastify/Express) to require auth before the query is executed.
    npm

A pragmatic security model for your service

    Identity (who)

        Use OIDC/OAuth2 for the web client (Auth0/Okta/GitHub OIDC). For the CLI, use Device Code flow or issue PATs (API keys) first; you can harden later.

        In Fastify, plugins like @fastify/jwt or @fastify/oauth2 make this straightforward.
        GitHub+1

    AuthZ (what they can touch)

        Coarse: protect /sparql, /update, /gsp with JWT middleware.

        Fine: model tenants/projects as named graphs. For each request, derive the caller‚Äôs allowed graph set and:

            READ: restrict the default dataset to allowed graphs (e.g., set sources/graphs for Comunica).

            WRITE: validate that INSERT/DELETE target graphs ‚äÜ allowed graphs; reject otherwise.

        Alternative isolation: one quadstore per tenant (simpler rules, more processes).

    Provenance (who did what)

        Map user ‚Üí Agent IRI. On each write, add triples like:

            prov:wasAttributedTo <agent>

            prov:generatedAtTime "2025-08-18T..."^^xsd:dateTime

            optionally dcterms:creator, commit hash, source file IRI.

        Keep an append-only audit log (JSONL) alongside the triples.

    Abuse & cost controls

        Timeouts and result limits on queries; for Comunica you can pass an httpTimeout in the context. Add server-side caps as a backstop.
        Comunica

        Rate-limit endpoints, enforce max payload sizes, and check UPDATE sizes.

    Transport

        Always TLS. For local-only development, bind to 127.0.0.1 and still require a token to hit /update.

‚ÄúShould the CLI use the same API as the web client‚Äîeven locally?‚Äù

Yes‚Äîthat‚Äôs a clean local-first pattern:

    Run your API on localhost; the CLI calls the same authenticated endpoints as the browser. Issue the CLI a token (store in OS keychain) or use Device Code flow.

    Keep an offline mode in the CLI that calls your core library directly for pure file ops, but default to the API path so behavior stays consistent.

Minimal Fastify shape (what this looks like)

    preHandler: verify JWT ‚Üí attach { userId, agentIri, scopes }.

    For /sparql (Comunica or Quadstore):

        Build the engine context from { allowedGraphs, httpTimeout }.

        On UPDATE, statically analyze the query to ensure targets are allowed.

    For /gsp (Graph Store Protocol CRUD), enforce graph ACLs per method. (GSP is the standard HTTP CRUD for named graphs.)

TL;DR

    SPARQL has no built-in auth; put HTTP auth in front and enforce graph-level authorization in your service.
    W3C

    Comunica can auth to sources (Basic, Solid OIDC) and supports timeouts; for user auth on your endpoint, use your framework or proxy.
    Comunica+1
    GitHub

    Quadstore relies on you for auth; it runs SPARQL via quadstore-comunica.
    GitHub
    npm

    Having the CLI use the same API as the web client (even locally) is a good idea for consistency and provenance.

If you want, I can sketch the Fastify route guards (JWT + per-graph ACL) and a tiny wrapper that forwards a /sparql POST into Comunica with httpTimeout and a graph whitelist.

What is "Device Code flow"?

I think we can lean heavily into github. When you start the service, maybe it should already have a default identity that could be verified with github. But API calls should be attributable, so clients should have to pass in something that can be associated with an identity, at least optionally.
ChatGPT said:

Great questions. Here‚Äôs the crisp version and a concrete way to wire it with GitHub.
What ‚ÄúDevice Code flow‚Äù is

It‚Äôs the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant (RFC 8628): a CLI or input-constrained app asks the auth server for a short user_code and a verification URL (e.g., github.com/login/device). The user opens that URL in any browser, enters the code, approves the app, and meanwhile the CLI polls the token endpoint. When approved, the CLI gets an access token.

OAuth
Using GitHub for identity

GitHub supports this flow for both OAuth Apps and GitHub Apps (you must enable Device Flow in the app settings). The steps are:

    Start: POST to https://github.com/login/device/code with your app‚Äôs client_id and requested scope. You get device_code, user_code, verification_uri (=https://github.com/login/device), interval, expires_in.

    User verifies: user visits the verification URI, enters the code, and authorizes.

    Poll: your backend polls https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token with device_code at the given interval until success (or timeout).

    Identify: call GitHub‚Äôs API (e.g., /user) with the token to learn who it is; then mint your own session token.

Recommended auth shape for your service

Goal: attribute every API call to a person (GitHub identity) and optionally control access, without forcing GitHub tokens on every request.

    Broker GitHub once, then mint your own JWT

        Web: use Auth Code + PKCE with GitHub;
        CLI: use Device Code flow.

        On success, your server creates a short-lived service JWT (sub = github_user_id, includes login, name, your Agent IRI, and scopes). Return this to the client; the client uses Authorization: Bearer <service-jwt> for API calls.

        Don‚Äôt pass GitHub access tokens around to each API‚Äîkeep them server-side.

    Map to provenance

        For writes, stamp triples like prov:wasAttributedTo <agent-iri>, prov:generatedAtTime, etc., derived from the JWT claims.

    Authorization

        Keep it simple to start: roles (admin, writer, reader) + graph-level ACLs (allowed named graphs per user/org). Enforce on SPARQL UPDATE targets and query default dataset.

        Later, consider one-store-per-tenant isolation if that fits your ops.

    Local defaults

        On first run, let the operator link the service to a GitHub account via device flow (so the service can, e.g., read a private repo if needed).

        For purely local/offline tasks, allow an anonymous mode that mints a locally-signed JWT flagged unverified:true; provenance will show an ‚Äúunverified‚Äù Agent IRI.

    CLI and web should hit the same API‚Äîeven locally

        Yes. Run the API on 127.0.0.1 with TLS if possible; the CLI does Device Code once, stores the service JWT in the OS keychain, and uses the same endpoints as the browser. This keeps attribution and behavior consistent.

Where Comunica/Quadstore fit with auth

    Quadstore runs in-process‚Äîguard your endpoints (JWT), then enforce ACLs before executing SPARQL (it uses a Comunica engine under the hood).

    Comunica over files (if you expose it): put it behind your framework and require the same JWT; pass timeouts/limits in the query context to prevent abuse.

If you want, I can sketch the three tiny endpoints you‚Äôll need (/auth/device/start, /auth/device/poll, /auth/callback) and the JWT payload that cleanly maps to a PROV Agent IRI.
You said:
API calls may be made by synthetic agents, but they should still be attributable to a person. Or organization really, but that seems trickier. But yes, go ahead and sketch out the endpoints.
ChatGPT said:

Love it. Here‚Äôs a tight, practical endpoint sketch that covers human auth (via GitHub Device Code), synthetic agents attributable to a person (or org later), and how every request becomes provenance-ready.
1) Endpoints (HTTP contract)
1) Start device flow (for people, incl. CLI)

POST /auth/device/start
Body: { "scopes": ["read", "write"] }
200:

{
  "device_code": "srv_dc_‚Ä¶",        // server-tracked
  "user_code": "ABCD-EFGH",
  "verification_uri": "https://github.com/login/device",
  "interval": 5,
  "expires_in": 900
}

Server stores device_code ‚Üí pending session with requested scopes.
2) Poll for completion

POST /auth/device/poll
Body: { "device_code": "srv_dc_‚Ä¶" }
200 (when user finished consent on GitHub):

{
  "principal": {
    "id": "gh:123456",             // GitHub user id
    "login": "octocat",
    "name": "Octo Cat",
    "agentIri": "https://‚Ä¶/agents/gh:123456"
  },
  "access_token": "svc_jwt_‚Ä¶",     // short-lived service JWT (not GH token)
  "refresh_token": "svc_rt_‚Ä¶",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "scopes": ["read", "write"]
}

Internally: server exchanges device_code with GitHub ‚Üí gets GH access token ‚Üí fetches /user ‚Üí mints service JWT that your API will trust on subsequent calls.
3) Refresh

POST /auth/refresh
Body: { "refresh_token": "svc_rt_‚Ä¶" } ‚Üí new short-lived access_token.
4) Create a synthetic agent (attributable to a person)

POST /agents (requires human Authorization: Bearer <svc_jwt>)
Body:

{
  "name": "publisher-bot",
  "scopes": ["write"],
  "graphs": ["https://‚Ä¶/ns/foo/_g/main"],   // optional per-agent ACL narrowing
  "auth": { "type": "api_key", "expires_in": 0 } // 0 = non-expiring (rotate-able)
}

201:

{
  "agent": { "id": "agt_8yj‚Ä¶", "owner": "gh:123456", "name": "publisher-bot" },
  "api_key": "ak_live_‚Ä¶",         // show once; store securely by the agent
  "agentIri": "https://‚Ä¶/agents/agt_8yj‚Ä¶"
}

This records ownership ‚Üí person. You can later add org ownership.
5) Agent exchanges API key for short-lived JWT

POST /auth/agent/token
Headers: X-API-Key: ak_live_‚Ä¶
200:

{
  "access_token": "svc_jwt_‚Ä¶",     // includes both owner (person) and actor (agent)
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "agent": { "id": "agt_8yj‚Ä¶", "owner": "gh:123456" }
}

6) (Optional) Rotate agent key

POST /agents/{agentId}/rotate (owner only) ‚Üí returns new api_key.
7) SPARQL endpoints (guarded)

    POST /sparql ‚Äì query

    POST /sparql/update ‚Äì update

    PUT/POST/DELETE /gsp?graph=<IRI> ‚Äì Graph Store Protocol (CRUD named graphs)
    All require Authorization: Bearer <svc_jwt> and enforce graph-level ACLs.

2) Service JWT (what‚Äôs inside)

Issued by your service (not GitHub). Short-lived (e.g., 1h).

{
  "iss": "https://semantic-flow.local",
  "aud": "semantic-flow-api",
  "exp": 1723999999,
  "sub": "gh:123456",                   // principal (person) ‚Äî ultimate owner
  "act": { "type": "synthetic", "id": "agt_8yj‚Ä¶" }, // present if agent
  "login": "octocat",
  "name": "Octo Cat",
  "agentIri": "https://‚Ä¶/agents/gh:123456",         // if human; else owner agent IRI too
  "org": null,                         // or "gh-org:9999" later
  "scopes": ["read", "write"],
  "graphs": ["‚Ä¶/ns/foo/_g/main"]       // optional down-scoping baked into token
}

    sub = person (ultimate principal)

    act = actor (synthetic agent) when applicable

    Use this pair to stamp provenance and to enforce policy.

3) Request handling (authZ + provenance)

Pre-handler middleware:

    Verify JWT ‚Üí ctx.user = principal, ctx.actor = agent|null, ctx.scopes, ctx.graphsAllowed.

    For /sparql/update and /gsp: statically inspect target graphs; ensure ‚äÜ graphsAllowed. Reject otherwise.

    Add provenance context to the engine:

        On writes, add quads:

            _:activity a prov:Activity ; prov:wasAssociatedWith <agent-or-person-IRI> ;

            prov:actedOnBehalfOf <person-IRI> ; prov:generatedAtTime "‚Ä¶"^^xsd:dateTime .

        Optionally record an append-only JSONL audit entry with the same data.

4) Org attribution (when you‚Äôre ready)

Two patterns (support both later):

    User-in-org: after GitHub login, check org membership; set org claim for policy (e.g., org-scoped graphs).

    GitHub App installation: link an installation to a ‚Äútenant‚Äù; tokens minted for that installation set org based on installation id. Synthetic agents can be owned by an org (then sub = gh-org:‚Ä¶, with a required onBehalfOf = gh:person claim at mint time).

Start with person-owned agents; add orgs when needed.
5) CLI + web, local or remote (same contract)

    CLI: call /auth/device/start ‚Üí user pastes code in browser ‚Üí /auth/device/poll ‚Üí store access_token in OS keychain ‚Üí call /sparql etc. with Authorization: Bearer ‚Ä¶.

    Web: standard OAuth (Auth Code + PKCE) ‚Üí server mints the same service JWT.

    Local or remote doesn‚Äôt matter‚Äîthe API and attribution are identical.

6) Minimal data model (tables/collections)

    principals: { id: "gh:123456", login, name, agentIri }

    agents: { id, ownerPrincipalId, name, scopes, graphs, createdAt }

    agent_credentials: { agentId, apiKeyHash, createdAt, revokedAt? }

    refresh_tokens: { principalId, agentId?, tokenHash, expiresAt }

    graph_acl (optional if you bake into JWT): { subjectId, graphs[] }

    audit_log (append-only): per write/query, record principalId, agentId?, target graphs, time, hash.

Why this meets your goals

    Every call is attributable to a person (sub), even when a synthetic agent (act) makes it.

    Easy to expand to orgs later without breaking the model.

    Works great for local-first (CLI hits the same API as the web).

    Provenance is automatic: you have the IRIs to stamp prov:* on writes.

If you want, I can turn this into a tiny Fastify scaffold (routes + JWT mint/verify helpers + SPARQL guard) so you can drop it into your new repo.
