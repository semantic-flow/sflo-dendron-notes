reference nodes are the main semantic constituents of a [[sflow.concept.mesh]]

Like all [[sflow.concept.mesh.resource.node]], they have an [[sflow.concept.mesh.resource.element.node-handle]]

The defining feature of a **reference node** is that it has an associated [[sflow.concept.mesh.resource.element.reference-dataset]]. It is a resource in the conventional RDF sense that it can be referred to in RDF data, i.e. as the subject or object of a triple.
