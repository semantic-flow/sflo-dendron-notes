Everything file in an [[sflo.concept.mesh.resource.folder._assets]] (or its subfolders) is considered an asset.

Even though they will have a URL in the [[sflo.concept.namespace.base]], they are not considered "mesh resources".

## Special Assets

Prefixed with an underscore, these assets have a special role to play in the "weave process"
