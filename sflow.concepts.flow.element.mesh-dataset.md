A **mesh dataset** contains system-related administrative and structural metadata for every [[sflow.concepts.mesh.node]]. It refers not to the node's referent (dataset or things), but the nodes, elements, repos and namespaces themselves.

Physically, it exists as a [[sflow.concepts.flow.folder.dataset]] in the [[sflow.concepts.flow.folder.node]].
