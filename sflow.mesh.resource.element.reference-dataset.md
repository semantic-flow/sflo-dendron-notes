- one of the [[semantic flow elements|sflow.mesh.resource.element]]
- used for attaching data to a [[sflow.mesh.resource.node.reference]]
- physically represented as a [[sflow.mesh.resource.folder._ref]]
- logically represented as a [[sflow.mesh.dataset]] or [[related-topics.dcat.dataset-series]]
- not a [[sflow.mesh.resource.node]], so doesn't have a [[sflow.mesh.resource.element.flow-dataset]]
