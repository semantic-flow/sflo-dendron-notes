Benji was waiting on the roof. We stepped through the [[loc.fr.shadow-keep.portal]] an arrived at [[loc.fr.sigil-sanctum]]. [[ch.mordenkainen]]'s eyes were blodshoot, smears on his forehead. Notes were scattered, crumpled. Spiders attended to crystals on strings on a loom. It seemed a familiar augery. 

[[ch.zintara]] and I headed straight to the bar. After a few moments Tserro joined us for a drink. Then, at Mordenkainen's urging, we took a seat.

Mordenkainen: There is a pocket of time frozen before the midnight of world. I suspect the fragment has a role. You've encountered temporal anomalies, but you are going right to edge of the liminal world, the border of darkness. You must go to this dark future and snatch the rod back to our time so we can make use of it. By my calculation, these are the last moments before our world ends. But who knows the experience of those in the pocket. There are those who say freezing time for a moment is freezing it for eternity.

[[ch.tserro]]: We'll do it!

I slammed my drink and we jumped into the portal. Falling through a lightning storm and emerging from clouds, we saw pinpricks of light, waves of purple, glue, and green. Rolling over, the edges of the sky hang like flesh from a throat torn open and within, its vertiginous depths turning my stomach. I realized I was falling upwards towards giant bones, an impossibly huge corpse, broken pieces... unholy shapes twisting and shifting in an unfathomable white depth. Lights and shadows flash and blink... a broken ship spread across the landscape. Closer still a ruined city, and we touched down like a feather. Gravity was sticky

We stood in a town square, a familiar northern architecture. The cobblestones trailed off into nothingness. Tserro and I noticed, crouching behind a half-pillar, a creature looking onward. Sil faded off into the shadows. The figure popped out, scurried 10ft further down the path, and crouch in hiding again. Tserro shadow-stepped into her previous location and Zin followed. 

The [[figure|ch.lisan]] was of unfamiliar race. 

Sil greeted her telepathically.

[[ch.lisan]]: Who's there? What do you want?

Sil kicked some rocks. He must've been speaking with her telepathically.

[[ch.lisan]]: I seek my brother. Can you help me?

Sil: We seek a bar. 

[[ch.lisan]]: Who are "we"?

Her eyes went to narrow slits and all the loose rocks in an area lifted up and then shot apart. Some caught unnaturally on Tserro.

[[ch.lisan]]: Come out!!!

Tserro shadow-stepped to near to her.

[[ch.lisan]]: Who are you , mind-talker!

Sil [telepathically]: We are the Shadows. We will help you find your brother.

She looked around, confused. "How are we here!" Eyes watering, she shook her head. "I go this way."

Zintara sheathed her weapons, and we started following her.

[[ch.lisan]]:  We were separated. I must find him. Our ship...

Zin: We saw a ship up yonder.

[[ch.lisan]]:  Maybe he's up ahead.

Sil: What are you? We are humans.

[[ch.lisan]]: We are Githyanki!

We came around a bend in the path.

Pillars floated in space. Blobs of energy floated and shimmered. Tserro started running and jumped, and a bolt shot in his direction. Zin took the lead.
