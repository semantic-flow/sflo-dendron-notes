- theoretically every resource [[sflow.concepts.reference-page]] could look
  different or even be generated by a different site generator

## Issues

### excluded

- do we really take out the _x/ ? otherwise the pages site can just point to the
  root directory and there's no need for _x
  - it's not like letting _x be accessible takes up more space
  - maybe a client-side script in resources pages can do checksums and/or path
    scans to detect whether it's up-to-date
