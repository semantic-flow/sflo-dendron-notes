# Semantic Flow Frequently Asked Questions

This section addresses common questions about Semantic Flow design principles and architecture.

## Design Principles

### [[Why are there elements at the top of a repo?|sflo.faq.why-are-there-elements-at-the-top-of-a-repo]]
The repository root can be a mesh node, in which case `_meta-component/` and `_handle/` elements appear at the top level. 

## Architecture Questions

*More FAQ entries will be added as common questions arise.*
