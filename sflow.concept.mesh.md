## Overview

A **semantic mesh** is a dereferenceable, versioned collection of semantic data and other resources where every HTTP URL returns meaningful content. It serves as the foundational structure for organizing and publishing semantic web resources through [[semantic sites|sflow.concept.semantic-site]].

Key characteristics:
- **Addressable**: Every component has a unique URL-based identifier
- **Dereferenceable**: All URLs return meaningful content when accessed
- **Versioned**: Changes are tracked and managed through the [[weave|sflow.concept.weave]] process
- **Publish-ready**: Can be served directly via GitHub Pages or similar static hosting; or via a local web server like live-server

## Core Components

### Mesh Resources

Every component in a semantic mesh is an addressable [[mesh resource|sflow.concept.mesh.resource]]. There are three primary categories:

#### Nodes
[[Mesh nodes|sflow.concept.mesh.resource.node]] are the primary structural components, physically represented as [[mesh folders|sflow.concept.mesh.resource.folder]]. They extend namespaces and serve as containers:

- **[[Namespace nodes|sflow.concept.mesh.resource.node.namespace]]**: Empty containers for organizing other mesh nodes
- **[[Semantic nodes|sflow.concept.mesh.resource.node.reference]]**: Nodes that refer to external entities (people, concepts, relationships) and contain [[reference datasets|sflow.concept.mesh.resource.element.reference-dataset]]
- **[[data nodes|sflow.concept.mesh.resource.node.data]]**: Nodes containing data distributions with optional versioning
- **[[Dataset series nodes|sflow.concept.mesh.resource.node.data.series]]**: User-defined collections that organize related datasets as [[DCAT dataset series|related-topics.dcat.dataset-series]]

#### Elements
[[Mesh elements|sflow.concept.mesh.resource.element]] are supporting components that define and systematize nodes:

##### User Elements
User elements are modifiable by users:
- **[[Reference datasets|sflow.concept.mesh.resource.element.reference-dataset]]**: Data about a semantic node's referent
- **[[Asset trees|sflow.concept.mesh.resource.element.asset-tree]]**: Collections of arbitrary files and folders attached to the mesh

##### System Elements
System elements are generated by [[weave|sflow.concept.weave]]:
- **[[meta datasets|sflow.concept.mesh.resource.element.meta-dataset]]**: System-related administrative and structural metadata for mesh nodes
- **[[Version datasets|sflow.concept.mesh.resource.element.version-dataset]]**: Versioned snapshots of datasets
- **[[V-series dataset series|sflow.concept.mesh.resource.element.v-series-dataset-series]]**: System-managed collections of version datasets that track the historical series of checkpoints for versioned datasets
- **[[Next datasets|sflow.concept.mesh.resource.element.next-dataset]]**: Draft workspaces for ongoing changes to versioned datasets
- **[[Node handles|sflow.concept.mesh.resource.element.node-handle]]**: Elements that provide referential indirection, allowing references to nodes as mesh resources rather than their referents
- **[[Resource pages|sflow.concept.mesh.resource.element.resource-page]]**: Generated index.html files

#### Files
Terminal [[mesh resources|sflow.concept.mesh.resource]] that cannot contain other resources:
- **[[Resource pages|sflow.concept.mesh.resource.element.resource-page]]**: index.html files present in every mesh folder after weaving
- **[[Distribution files|sflow.concept.mesh.resource-facet.distribution]]**: Data files in various RDF formats
- **[[__unversion files|sflow.concept.mesh.resource.element.__unversion]]**: Sentinel files that prevent version creation during weaving
- **README.md and CHANGELOG.md**: Documentation files providing context


## Physical Structure

### Folder Mapping
- Mesh nodes correspond physically to [[mesh folders|sflow.concept.mesh.resource.folder]]
- Folder names become namespace segments and URL path components
- The local name of a node matches its containing folder name

### File Organization
- [[Datasets|sflow.concept.mesh.resource-facet.dataset]] are represented by folders containing at least one distribution file
- Distribution files must be named using the dataset's [[namespace segment|sflow.concept.namespace.segment]]
- Resource pages (index.html) should be present in every mesh folder after [[weaving|sflow.concept.weave]]

### Reserved Names
- All reserved resource names begin with an underscore (_)
- Examples: `_meta/`, `_assets/`, `_ref/`, `_v-series/`

## Logical Structure

### Namespace Extension
- Mesh folders always extend the namespace with a segment corresponding to the folder name
- This creates a hierarchical URL structure for addressing resources
- Each resource has a unique [[identifier|sflow.concept.identifier]] based on its path and local name

### Containment Rules
- **Mesh nodes** are always containers (or potential containers) of other nodes and elements
  - **Namespace nodes**: Can contain any other mesh nodes
  - **Semantic nodes**: Must have reference datasets; can contain other nodes except asset nodes
  - **data nodes**: Can only contain a catalog, an optional asset node, and required distributions
  - **Dataset series nodes**: Can contain version series elements and system elements
- **Assets tree elements**: Cannot contain other mesh nodes (except for their meta dataset)

## Rules & Constraints

### System vs User Boundaries
- **System elements**: Generated and managed by the weave process, not intended for user modification
- **User elements**: Directly modifiable by users (reference datasets, meta datasets, README.md, CHANGELOG.md)
- The weave process maintains system elements and generates missing required components

### Versioning Requirements
- Semantic nodes must have reference datasets
- Dataset versioning is managed through the [[dataset versioning|sflow.concept.dataset-versioning]] system
- Version history is stored in `_v-series/` folders with numbered version snapshots
- [[V-series dataset series|sflow.concept.mesh.resource.element.v-series-dataset-series]] manage the historical checkpoints and prevent infinite recursion in versioning

### Addressing Requirements
- Every mesh resource must be addressable via its URL path
- URLs must return meaningful content when dereferenced
- Resource pages provide human-readable access to all mesh components

## Integration Points

### Weave Process
The [[weave|sflow.concept.weave]] process maintains mesh integrity by:
- Checking for required system resources and creating them if missing
- Generating resource pages for changed components
- Managing dataset versioning and metadata
- Ensuring all resources remain addressable and dereferenceable

### Publishing Workflow
- Meshes are designed to be served directly as static sites
- GitHub Pages integration allows immediate publishing after repository updates
- No static site generator required, though resource page generation occurs during weaving
- The repository structure directly maps to the published URL structure

### Dataset Integration
Meshes support multiple RDF formats and follow [[DCAT v3|related-topics.dcat.vocabulary]] standards for dataset organization. [[Datasets|sflow.concept.mesh.resource-facet.dataset]] within meshes include both standalone datasets and those embedded as mesh elements.
