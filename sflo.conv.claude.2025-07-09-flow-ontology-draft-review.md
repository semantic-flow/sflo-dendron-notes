OK, let's fix up this draft of the flow ontology.

Edit
I'd be happy to help you fix up your flow ontology draft, but I don't see any draft content in your message (.95). Could you share the current version you're working on?

Also, to give you the most useful feedback, it would help to know:

What specific issues or areas you want to focus on?
What domain or context this flow ontology is meant to address?
Are there particular aspects (structure, terminology, relationships, etc.) you're most concerned about?



it's in C:\Users\drich\hub\semantic-flow\sf-workspace\flow-ontology\alpha\_node-data\_next

Edit
I'll help you examine and fix up your flow ontology draft. Let me first check what directories are accessible and then look at the files in that location.

F


list_allowed_directories


F


list_directory


F


read_file


Now I can see your flow ontology draft (.95). This is a well-structured RDF/OWL ontology for a semantic mesh architecture. Here are the main issues I notice and suggestions for improvement:

Structural Issues
1. Missing URI declarations (.85) Your classes and properties lack proper URI namespace declarations. Currently they're implicitly in the default namespace <>, but you should define a proper base URI:

turtle
@prefix sf: <http://semanticflow.org/ontology/> .
@base <http://semanticflow.org/ontology/> .
2. Inconsistent property domains/ranges (.90)

hasMetadata is declared as ObjectProperty but should link to MetadataComponent
Some properties like hasVersion are defined as DatatypeProperty but others that should be are missing
3. Missing inverse properties (.80) Properties like refersTo, isHandleFor should have inverses for better reasoning.

Conceptual Issues
4. Mixing implementation details with ontology (.75) Comments reference specific directory structures (_current/, _next/, _v1/) which seem implementation-specific. The ontology should be more abstract.

5. Unclear distinction between some classes (.70)

NodeHandle vs MeshNodeHandle - why two separate classes?
Dataset extends dcat:Dataset but then has subclasses that might not fit DCAT semantics
Missing Elements
6. No temporal/versioning model (.80) You mention versioning but don't model temporal relationships between versions.

7. No provenance or authorship (.75) Missing properties for who created/modified resources.

What specific aspects are you most concerned about? Are you trying to model an actual implementation or keep it more abstract? This will help me prioritize the fixes.




I don't want to define a base URL now, and maybe never. So I can move it around. I at least want to experiment with not specifying those to see what headaches it cause.

Note the recommended prefix is flow:

Not sure what you're saying about hasMetadata but I changed it to hasMetadataComponent

I think we can add dcterms:identifier to MeshResource. It's mandatory, so maybe we use SHACL?

Edit
You're right about keeping it flexible without a base URL - that's a smart experimental approach (.85). Let me address your points:

Prefix recommendation noted - flow: is much cleaner than sf:.

hasMetadata → hasMetadataComponent - good fix, that's clearer (.90).

dcterms:identifier + SHACL - yes, that makes sense (.85). Using dcterms:identifier as a mandatory property via SHACL shapes would be cleaner than mixing cardinality constraints into the ontology itself.

Looking at your ontology again, I see a few other areas to clarify:

1. NodeHandle vs MeshNodeHandle redundancy (.80) You have both NodeHandle (a MeshElement) and MeshNodeHandle (standalone class). Is this intentional? The comments suggest they serve similar purposes.

2. Dataset hierarchy (.70) Your NodeComponent and ComponentLayer extend dcat:Dataset, but ComponentLayer represents versioned snapshots - does that align with DCAT's dataset semantics, or would dcat:Distribution be more appropriate for layers?

3. Implementation leakage (.75) Comments mention specific directory names (_meta-component/, _current/, etc.). Should these be more abstract in the ontology, or do you want to explicitly model the file system structure?

Do you want me to draft the SHACL shapes for the mandatory identifier constraint? And should I focus on cleaning up the class hierarchy first, or are there other specific issues bothering you about the current draft?




the identifier is determined by the folder name or file name. maybe we put off a decision on whether it's necessary to keep it in RDF, but I suspect it will be.

I don't think we need our own "Distribution" so removed it. 

NodeComponent is dcat:DatasetSeries, corrected.

How do we specify that NodeComponent is abstract?

Edit
NodeComponent as dcat:DatasetSeries - that's a much better fit (.90). DatasetSeries is exactly what you want for persistent dataset collections that evolve over time.

Making NodeComponent abstract - in OWL, you have a few options (.85):

Disjoint union (cleanest):
turtle
NodeComponent owl:equivalentClass [
    owl:unionOf ( MetadataComponent ReferenceComponent DataComponent AssetTree )
] .

[ rdf:type owl:AllDisjointClasses ;
    owl:members ( MetadataComponent ReferenceComponent DataComponent AssetTree )
] .
SHACL constraint (if you're using SHACL anyway):
turtle
# In your shapes file
:NodeComponentShape a sh:NodeShape ;
    sh:targetClass :NodeComponent ;
    sh:not [ sh:class :NodeComponent ] ;  # No direct instances
    sh:message "NodeComponent is abstract - use a specific subclass" .
OWL restriction (more complex):
turtle
NodeComponent rdfs:subClassOf [
    owl:unionOf ( MetadataComponent ReferenceComponent DataComponent AssetTree )
] .
The disjoint union approach is probably cleanest - it says NodeComponent is exactly the union of its concrete subclasses, with no overlap.

Identifier question - if it's derived from folder/file names, it probably should stay in RDF for querying and linking purposes (.80). You'll likely want to reference nodes by identifier in queries.

Which approach for abstract classes feels right to you?




You said this before... I don't think the #1 actually prohibits NodeComponent

Also AssetTree is not a component

Edit
You're absolutely right on both points (.95):

#1 doesn't prohibit NodeComponent instances - the disjoint union just says NodeComponent is equivalent to the union of its subclasses, but doesn't prevent direct instantiation of NodeComponent itself.

AssetTree is not a component - looking at your ontology, AssetTree is a MeshElement that manages file collections, not a NodeComponent. The actual NodeComponent subclasses should be:

MetadataComponent
ReferenceComponent
DataComponent
For truly making NodeComponent abstract, you'd need something like:

turtle
# This creates a contradiction if someone tries to instantiate NodeComponent directly
NodeComponent rdfs:subClassOf [
    owl:complementOf NodeComponent
] .
But that's hacky. The cleaner approach is probably just SHACL validation or documentation stating it's abstract (.80).

So the corrected disjoint union would be:

turtle
[ rdf:type owl:AllDisjointClasses ;
    owl:members ( MetadataComponent ReferenceComponent DataComponent )
] .
Should I focus on other structural issues, or do you want to nail down the abstract class approach first?




So you're saying I should have a separate shapes file?

Edit
Not necessarily (.70). You have a few options:

1. Same file - You can put SHACL shapes directly in your .trig file alongside the ontology. Many people do this, especially for smaller ontologies.

2. Separate shapes file - This is cleaner separation of concerns. The ontology defines what CAN exist, shapes define what SHOULD exist in your data.

3. No SHACL at all - Just document that NodeComponent is abstract and rely on your application logic to enforce it.

Given that you're experimenting and want flexibility, I'd lean toward option #1 (same file) for now (.75). You can always split them later if the file gets unwieldy.

If you do want SHACL in the same file, you'd just add:

turtle
:NodeComponentShape a sh:NodeShape ;
    sh:targetClass :NodeComponent ;
    sh:sparql [
        sh:message "NodeComponent is abstract - use MetadataComponent, ReferenceComponent, or DataComponent" ;
        sh:select """
            SELECT $this WHERE {
                $this rdf:type/rdfs:subClassOf* :NodeComponent .
                $this rdf:type :NodeComponent .
                FILTER NOT EXISTS { $this rdf:type ?subclass . ?subclass rdfs:subClassOf :NodeComponent . FILTER(?subclass != :NodeComponent) }
            }
        """ ;
    ] .
What feels right for your experimental approach?




Let's try same file for now... but isn't this more concise:

# In your shapes file :NodeComponentShape a sh:NodeShape ; sh:targetClass :NodeComponent ; sh:not [ sh:class :NodeComponent ] ; # No direct instances sh:message "NodeComponent is abstract - use a specific subclass" .

Edit
You're absolutely right (.95) - that's much more concise! And it does exactly what we want:

turtle
:NodeComponentShape a sh:NodeShape ;
    sh:targetClass :NodeComponent ;
    sh:not [ sh:class :NodeComponent ] ;  # No direct instances
    sh:message "NodeComponent is abstract - use a specific subclass" .
This says "for anything that's a NodeComponent, it must NOT be directly of class NodeComponent" - which forces it to be a subclass instance instead.

Much cleaner than my SPARQL approach (.85). SHACL's logical constraints are usually more readable than custom SPARQL queries for simple cases like this.

You'll need to add the SHACL prefix:

turtle
@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .
Should we add this to your ontology file and tackle the other structural issues, or do you want to add more SHACL constraints while we're at it (like the mandatory dcterms:identifier)?




MeshElement or just Element

Edit
Element (.80).

"Mesh" is already implied by context since everything in your ontology is part of the mesh architecture. Adding "Mesh" to every class name gets repetitive - you already have MeshResource and MeshNode, but then you drop it for things like DataNode, ReferenceNode, etc.

Keeping it consistent as just "Element" is cleaner and follows the pattern you've established with the node types. The hierarchy reads better:

MeshResource
├── MeshNode
│   ├── NamespaceNode  
│   ├── ReferenceNode
│   └── DataNode
└── Element
    ├── MetadataComponent
    ├── NodeHandle  
    ├── ReferenceComponent
    ├── DataComponent
    └── AssetTree
Plus shorter names are easier to work with in queries and code.




NodeComponent or Component?

Edit
Component (.85).

You're being consistent with dropping the redundant prefix - you already simplified MeshElement to Element, and "Node" is implied by context since these components only exist within nodes.

The class hierarchy becomes cleaner:

Component (abstract)
├── MetadataComponent
├── ReferenceComponent  
└── DataComponent
And your property hasNodeComponent could become just hasComponent, which reads more naturally.

This also aligns better with your file system naming where you have _meta-component/, _ref-component/, etc. - the "component" part is what matters, not repeating "node" everywhere.




Should we define FileResource, FolderResource, Changelog, Readme, CurrentLayer, NextLayer, VersionLayer

Edit
Probably not in the core ontology (.75).

Those feel like implementation details that might change as your mesh architecture evolves. Your current ontology focuses on the conceptual structure (nodes, components, references) which is more stable.

Arguments against:

CurrentLayer, NextLayer, VersionLayer are just specific instances of ComponentLayer
FileResource, FolderResource are filesystem concepts that might not apply if you switch storage backends
Changelog, Readme are just specific types of DocumentationResource
However (.60), if you're finding yourself needing to query or reason about these specific types, then maybe they belong.

Middle ground: You could add them as individuals rather than classes:

turtle
:current a ComponentLayer ;
    rdfs:label "current snapshot" .

:next a ComponentLayer ;  
    rdfs:label "next snapshot" .
Or use a simple classification property:

turtle
:layerType rdf:type owl:DatatypeProperty ;
    rdfs:domain ComponentLayer ;
    rdfs:range xsd:string .  # "current", "next", "v1", etc.
What specific use cases are you thinking about for these classes? That might help decide if they're worth modeling explicitly.




CurrentLayer, NextLayer, VersionLayer are subclasses of the abstract ComponentLayer. I think they should be in.

Similarly, Changelog, Readme are subclasses of DocumentationResource. 

My ontology is tied closely to the filesystem implementation because the purpose of a Mesh is to allow a filesystem-based mesh with identifiers that dereference.

Edit
You're absolutely right (.90). If the ontology is designed to model a filesystem-based mesh where identifiers dereference to actual filesystem structures, then these concrete subclasses are essential, not implementation details.

The layered approach makes perfect sense:

turtle
ComponentLayer rdf:type owl:Class ;  # abstract
CurrentLayer rdfs:subClassOf ComponentLayer ;
NextLayer rdfs:subClassOf ComponentLayer ;
VersionLayer rdfs:subClassOf ComponentLayer ;

DocumentationResource rdf:type owl:Class ;  # you already have this
Changelog rdfs:subClassOf DocumentationResource ;
Readme rdfs:subClassOf DocumentationResource ;
This gives you the semantic precision needed for queries like "find all current snapshots" or "get the changelog for this node" while maintaining the abstract hierarchy.

For FileResource and FolderResource - since filesystem structure is core to your mesh, those probably belong too (.85). They'd help distinguish between file-based and directory-based assets within AssetTree elements.

Should we add SHACL shapes to make ComponentLayer abstract as well, using the same pattern as Component? And do you want to add any constraints about which layer types can exist within which component types?




Yes, ComponentLayer and DocumentationResource are both abstract

Edit
Perfect (.95). Adding the SHACL shapes for both abstract classes:

turtle
:ComponentLayerShape a sh:NodeShape ;
    sh:targetClass :ComponentLayer ;
    sh:not [ sh:class :ComponentLayer ] ;
    sh:message "ComponentLayer is abstract - use CurrentLayer, NextLayer, or VersionLayer" .

:DocumentationResourceShape a sh:NodeShape ;
    sh:targetClass :DocumentationResource ;
    sh:not [ sh:class :DocumentationResource ] ;
    sh:message "DocumentationResource is abstract - use Changelog, Readme, or other specific subclass" .
And you'll need to update your disjoint classes axioms:

turtle
[ rdf:type owl:AllDisjointClasses ;
    owl:members ( CurrentLayer NextLayer VersionLayer )
] .

[ rdf:type owl:AllDisjointClasses ;
    owl:members ( Changelog Readme )  # add others as you define them
] .
This maintains clean separation while enforcing that only concrete subclasses can be instantiated.

Should I help you draft the updated ontology file with all these changes, or do you want to tackle FileResource/FolderResource hierarchy first?




rdf:type vs "a"

Edit
Use "a" (.90).

It's more readable and concise. The RDF specs explicitly define a as syntactic sugar for rdf:type, so they're functionally identical.

Your ontology mixes both:

turtle
MeshResource rdf:type owl:Class ;  # verbose
[ rdf:type owl:AllDisjointClasses ;  # verbose
:ComponentLayerShape a sh:NodeShape ;  # clean
Stick with a throughout for consistency (.85). The only time you might prefer rdf:type is in SPARQL queries where some people find it more explicit, but even there a is standard.

So:

turtle
MeshResource a owl:Class ;
CurrentLayer a owl:Class ;
[ a owl:AllDisjointClasses ;
    owl:members ( CurrentLayer NextLayer VersionLayer )
] .
Much cleaner to read and write.




If we say "ComponentLayer rdfs:subClassOf FolderResource" then we don't have to say it for each of its subclasses, right? But maybe we want to for clarity?

Edit
Correct, inheritance is automatic (.95). If ComponentLayer rdfs:subClassOf FolderResource, then CurrentLayer, NextLayer, and VersionLayer automatically inherit that relationship through transitivity.

But explicit is often better (.80).

Arguments for explicit declarations:

Clearer intent when reading the ontology
Better tool support (some reasoners/validators work better with explicit statements)
Easier maintenance if you later want to change the hierarchy
Arguments for inheritance only:

DRY principle - don't repeat yourself
Less verbose
Changes to parent automatically apply to children
Given that your ontology is tightly coupled to filesystem implementation, I'd lean toward explicit declarations (.75). It makes the filesystem mapping crystal clear:

turtle
ComponentLayer rdfs:subClassOf FolderResource .
CurrentLayer rdfs:subClassOf ComponentLayer, FolderResource .
NextLayer rdfs:subClassOf ComponentLayer, FolderResource .
VersionLayer rdfs:subClassOf ComponentLayer, FolderResource .
This redundancy actually helps document your design intent that these are specifically folder-based structures.

What feels right for your use case?




Since ComponentLayer is abstract, maybe we don't say it's a FolderResource?

Edit
Good point (.85). If ComponentLayer is abstract and never instantiated, then the rdfs:subClassOf FolderResource relationship is purely conceptual.

You have two clean approaches:

Option 1: Only concrete classes extend FolderResource

turtle
ComponentLayer a owl:Class ;  # abstract, no filesystem assertion
CurrentLayer rdfs:subClassOf ComponentLayer, FolderResource .
NextLayer rdfs:subClassOf ComponentLayer, FolderResource .
VersionLayer rdfs:subClassOf ComponentLayer, FolderResource .
Option 2: Abstract class defines the contract

turtle
ComponentLayer rdfs:subClassOf FolderResource .  # all flow snapshots are folders
CurrentLayer rdfs:subClassOf ComponentLayer .    # inherits FolderResource
NextLayer rdfs:subClassOf ComponentLayer .
VersionLayer rdfs:subClassOf ComponentLayer .
I lean toward Option 1 (.75). It's more precise - the abstract class defines logical structure, while concrete classes define filesystem implementation. This also gives you flexibility if you later add a ComponentLayer subclass that isn't folder-based.

Plus it matches your pattern where you're being explicit about filesystem relationships for clarity.




Do we say, e.g. MeshNode subClassOf MeshResource, FolderResource? Or just FolderResource

Edit
Just FolderResource (.85).

Since you already have MeshNode rdfs:subClassOf MeshResource, adding it again in a multiple inheritance statement is redundant. OWL reasoners will infer the complete inheritance chain automatically.

So:

turtle
MeshNode rdfs:subClassOf MeshResource .
MeshNode rdfs:subClassOf FolderResource .
Or more concisely:

turtle
MeshNode rdfs:subClassOf MeshResource, FolderResource .
But avoid:

turtle
NamespaceNode rdfs:subClassOf MeshNode, MeshResource, FolderResource .  # redundant
The reasoner knows that if NamespaceNode rdfs:subClassOf MeshNode and MeshNode rdfs:subClassOf MeshResource, then NamespaceNode rdfs:subClassOf MeshResource (.90).

Keep it clean - only state the direct parent relationships. This makes the ontology easier to maintain and the inheritance hierarchy clearer to read.




But for NamespaceNode, we have to say subClassOf MeshNode, FolderResource

Edit
Yes, exactly (.90).

turtle
NamespaceNode rdfs:subClassOf MeshNode, FolderResource .
You need both because:

MeshNode → gives you the conceptual mesh structure
FolderResource → gives you the filesystem implementation detail
Even though MeshNode rdfs:subClassOf FolderResource would make FolderResource inherited, you're being explicit about the filesystem mapping for each concrete class. This is consistent with your approach of making the filesystem relationships clear.

So the pattern is:

turtle
MeshNode rdfs:subClassOf MeshResource, FolderResource .
NamespaceNode rdfs:subClassOf MeshNode, FolderResource .
ReferenceNode rdfs:subClassOf MeshNode, FolderResource .  
DataNode rdfs:subClassOf MeshNode, FolderResource .
This redundancy actually serves your documentation goal - anyone reading the ontology immediately sees that these are folder-based without having to trace inheritance chains.




and for Component, we say subClassOf dcat:DatasetSeries, Element, FolderResource ;

Edit
Yes, exactly (.95).

turtle
Component rdfs:subClassOf dcat:DatasetSeries, Element, FolderResource .
This gives Component its three essential aspects:

dcat:DatasetSeries → semantic meaning as a persistent dataset collection over time
Element → structural role in the mesh architecture
FolderResource → filesystem implementation as directories
And then the concrete subclasses inherit all three:

turtle
MetadataComponent rdfs:subClassOf Component .  # gets all three parents
ReferenceComponent rdfs:subClassOf Component .
DataComponent rdfs:subClassOf Component .
This keeps your pattern consistent - explicit about filesystem mapping while maintaining the conceptual hierarchy. The triple inheritance clearly documents that components are both semantic datasets and physical filesystem structures within the mesh element framework.




But that's a little inconsistent with our decision to not use FolderResource for abstract classes

Edit
You're absolutely right (.90). That's inconsistent with the decision we just made for ComponentLayer.

If we're not putting FolderResource on abstract classes, then:

turtle
Component rdfs:subClassOf dcat:DatasetSeries, Element .  # no FolderResource
MetadataComponent rdfs:subClassOf Component, FolderResource .
ReferenceComponent rdfs:subClassOf Component, FolderResource .  
DataComponent rdfs:subClassOf Component, FolderResource .
This maintains the principle that abstract classes define logical structure while concrete classes define filesystem implementation.

However (.75), there's a difference here - Component might be less abstract than ComponentLayer. Are you ever going to have Component subclasses that aren't folders? If all components are always folders by design, then maybe Component should declare that constraint.

What's your intent - is Component truly abstract like ComponentLayer, or is it more like a concrete base class where all instances happen to be folders?




And then MetadataComponent rdfs:subClassOf Component, FolderResource ; (no element or DSS)

Edit
Exactly (.95).

turtle
MetadataComponent rdfs:subClassOf Component, FolderResource .
No need to repeat Element or dcat:DatasetSeries since they're inherited from Component. This keeps it clean and follows the pattern of only stating direct relationships.

So the full pattern becomes:

turtle
Component rdfs:subClassOf dcat:DatasetSeries, Element .  # abstract
MetadataComponent rdfs:subClassOf Component, FolderResource .
ReferenceComponent rdfs:subClassOf Component, FolderResource .
DataComponent rdfs:subClassOf Component, FolderResource .
This is consistent with your decision to keep filesystem details on concrete classes only, while maintaining clean inheritance chains.




How do we say every FolderResource had a ResourcePage (I'd guess in SHACL)

Edit
Yes, SHACL is the right approach (.90).

turtle
:FolderResourceShape a sh:NodeShape ;
    sh:targetClass :FolderResource ;
    sh:property [
        sh:path :hasResourcePage ;  # or whatever property you use
        sh:class :ResourcePage ;
        sh:minCount 1 ;
        sh:maxCount 1 ;
        sh:message "Every FolderResource must have exactly one ResourcePage"
    ] .
You'll need to define the property if you haven't already:

turtle
:hasResourcePage a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:domain :FolderResource ;
    rdfs:range :ResourcePage ;
    rdfs:label "has resource page" ;
    rdfs:comment "Links a folder resource to its human-readable interface page (index.html)" .
This enforces that every folder must have its index.html page, which makes sense for your filesystem-based mesh where folders need web-accessible entry points.

Should it be exactly one ResourcePage (sh:maxCount 1) or could folders have multiple pages?




is "hasSourceLayer" a good name for the property that links a current snapshot to a version snapshot?  or is there a good dcat property already?

Since we have hasElement, we maybe don't need hasCompound?

Edit
hasSourceLayer seems unclear (.70). It could imply the current snapshot is derived from the version snapshot, but isn't it the opposite? The version snapshot is typically a snapshot/copy of the current snapshot.

Better options:

derivedFrom (PROV-O has prov:wasDerivedFrom)
hasSnapshot / snapshotOf
hasVersion / versionOf
dcat:hasVersion (though this is for datasets, might work)
DCAT properties to consider:

dcat:hasVersion / dcat:isVersionOf - designed exactly for this
prov:wasDerivedFrom - if you want to import PROV-O
I'd lean toward dcat:isVersionOf (.80):

turtle
:v1-layer dcat:isVersionOf :current-layer .
Re: hasCompound - you're right (.85). If you have hasElement for the node→element relationship, hasCompound seems redundant. What was hasCompound supposed to link?

The dcat:isVersionOf approach also fits your existing use of DCAT vocabulary.




The latest version snapshot has the same distribution as the current snapshot. (in case people want to refer to the current snapshot's data in an immutable way)

Edit
Ah, that clarifies the relationship (.90). The version snapshot is a frozen snapshot of current snapshot state, so people can reference "v1.2.3" instead of the moving target of "current".

For this use case, dcat:isVersionOf works perfectly:

turtle
:v1-layer dcat:isVersionOf :current-layer .
:v2-layer dcat:isVersionOf :current-layer .
This expresses that the version snapshots are immutable snapshots of the current snapshot. The inverse dcat:hasVersion would go the other way:

turtle
:current-layer dcat:hasVersion :v1-layer, :v2-layer .
Both directions could be useful (.85):

dcat:isVersionOf for "this version represents that moving target"
dcat:hasVersion for "this moving target has these frozen snapshots"
DCAT is designed exactly for this versioning pattern where you want stable references to evolving datasets. Much cleaner than inventing your own hasSourceLayer property.

Do you want to model both directions, or just one?




But I want to say "this current version is the same as/based on/currently"

Edit
Ah, you want the opposite direction (.90). You're saying "the current snapshot is currently representing/based on version v1.2.3".

For that relationship, you'd want:

turtle
:current-layer dcat:isVersionOf :v2-layer .
Or potentially:

prov:wasDerivedFrom - "current was derived from v2"
owl:sameAs - if they're truly identical content (.60 - probably too strong)
Custom property like basedOn or currentlyAt
But this feels backwards from typical versioning (.75). Usually current is the "head" and versions are snapshots of previous current states. Are you saying that when you create v2, you then update current to match v2?

Maybe you want:

turtle
:current-layer :representsVersion :v2-layer .
:current-layer :atVersion "v2.3.1"^^xsd:string .
What's the specific use case? Are you trying to say "current snapshot currently contains the same data as v2 layer"?




hasCompound links a Node to a component.

we'll need SHACL for "every node has hasMetadataComponent MetaCompound"

Edit
Ah, got it (.95). So the pattern is:

turtle
# Property linking nodes to their components
hasComponent a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:domain MeshNode ;
    rdfs:range Component .

# Specific property for metadata
hasMetadataComponent a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:subPropertyOf hasComponent ;
    rdfs:range MetadataComponent .
SHACL constraint:

turtle
:MeshNodeShape a sh:NodeShape ;
    sh:targetClass MeshNode ;
    sh:property [
        sh:path :hasMetadataComponent ;
        sh:class :MetadataComponent ;
        sh:minCount 1 ;
        sh:maxCount 1 ;
        sh:message "Every MeshNode must have exactly one MetadataComponent"
    ] .
This enforces that all nodes must have their _meta-component/ folder.

Should we also add similar constraints for other required components? Do all nodes need ReferenceComponent and DataComponent, or does it depend on the node type (e.g., ReferenceNodes need ReferenceComponent, DataNodes need DataComponent)?




"current" is really just a pointer to the latest version, but for convenience, it exposes distribution files that are identical to the latest version. when next starts out, it is also identical, but it can evolve (user-modifiable distribution)

Edit
Perfect, that makes the model clear (.95). So you have three states:

VersionLayers - immutable snapshots (v1, v2, etc.)
CurrentLayer - read-only pointer to latest version + convenience distributions
NextLayer - mutable working copy, starts as copy of current but can evolve
For the relationships:

turtle
# Current points to the latest immutable version
:current-layer :representsVersion :v2-layer .

# Next starts as a copy but can diverge
:next-layer prov:wasDerivedFrom :current-layer .
# or maybe: :next-layer :basedOn :current-layer .
When you're ready to release, you'd:

Create new version snapshot from next: v3-layer prov:wasDerivedFrom next-layer
Update current pointer: current-layer :representsVersion v3-layer
Reset next as copy of new current
This gives you the immutable references people need while allowing active development. The current snapshot's distributions are just convenience copies of the latest version's distributions.

Does that capture the workflow correctly? Should we model the "convenience copy" aspect explicitly, or is that just implementation detail?




I don't think we need hasComponent, since Component is abstract?

Edit
You're absolutely right (.90). Since Component is abstract and never instantiated, a property targeting the abstract class doesn't add value.

Instead, you'd have specific properties for each concrete component type:

turtle
hasMetadataComponent a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:domain MeshNode ;
    rdfs:range MetadataComponent .

hasReferenceComponent a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:domain MeshNode ;
    rdfs:range ReferenceComponent .

hasDataComponent a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:domain MeshNode ;
    rdfs:range DataComponent .
This is more precise and matches your filesystem structure where nodes have specific _meta-component/, _ref-component/, _data-component/ folders.

No need for the abstract hasComponent - you'd never query for "all components" since they're always one of the specific types. The concrete properties give you exactly the relationships you need for SHACL constraints and queries.




I don't think we want any of these data properties:

hasVersion a owl:DatatypeProperty ;
    rdfs:domain MeshResource ;
    rdfs:range xsd:string ;
    rdfs:comment "Specifies the version identifier for a mesh resource. Version tracking supports evolution and compatibility management in the mesh architecture."@en ;
    rdfs:label "has version"@en .

hasMetadata a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:domain MeshResource ;
    rdfs:range MetadataComponent ;
    rdfs:comment "Links mesh resources to their metadata flows. This property enables structured metadata management and discovery capabilities."@en ;
    rdfs:label "has metadata"@en .

dcterms:identifier a owl:DatatypeProperty ;
    rdfs:domain MeshResource ;
    rdfs:range xsd:string ;
    rdfs:comment "Mandatory unique identifier for all mesh resources. This property ensures every mesh resource has a stable identifier for referencing and discovery."@en ;
    rdfs:label "identifier"@en .

Edit
You're right to question these (.85).

hasVersion - if versioning is handled by the ComponentLayer system (CurrentLayer, NextLayer, VersionLayer), then a separate version property on MeshResource is redundant.

hasMetadata - this was the generic one we replaced with specific hasMetadataComponent etc. Can remove it.

dcterms:identifier - you shouldn't redefine existing DCMI properties (.90). If you want to use dcterms:identifier, just use it directly without redefinition. The SHACL constraint can enforce it's mandatory:

turtle
:MeshResourceShape a sh:NodeShape ;
    sh:targetClass MeshResource ;
    sh:property [
        sh:path dcterms:identifier ;
        sh:datatype xsd:string ;
        sh:minCount 1 ;
        sh:maxCount 1 ;
        sh:message "Every MeshResource must have exactly one dcterms:identifier"
    ] .
So you can drop all three property definitions and just use the SHACL constraint for the identifier requirement. Much cleaner.




Can you update this SHACL to also require exactly 1 NodeHandle?

Edit
turtle
:MeshNodeShape a sh:NodeShape ;
   sh:targetClass MeshNode ;
   sh:property [
       sh:path :hasMetadataComponent ;
       sh:class :MetadataComponent ;
       sh:minCount 1 ;
       sh:maxCount 1 ;
       sh:message "Every MeshNode must have exactly one MetadataComponent"
   ] ;
   sh:property [
       sh:path :hasNodeHandle ;
       sh:class :NodeHandle ;
       sh:minCount 1 ;
       sh:maxCount 1 ;
       sh:message "Every MeshNode must have exactly one NodeHandle"
   ] .
This adds the NodeHandle requirement to the existing MetadataComponent constraint (.90). You'll need the hasNodeHandle property defined if it isn't already:

turtle
hasNodeHandle a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:domain MeshNode ;
    rdfs:range NodeHandle .



We shouldn't re-define identifier, but should we specify that every MeshResource has an identifier?

Edit
Yes, absolutely (.90). You should constrain that every MeshResource must have a dcterms:identifier without redefining the property itself.

turtle
:MeshResourceShape a sh:NodeShape ;
    sh:targetClass MeshResource ;
    sh:property [
        sh:path dcterms:identifier ;
        sh:datatype xsd:string ;
        sh:minCount 1 ;
        sh:maxCount 1 ;
        sh:message "Every MeshResource must have exactly one dcterms:identifier"
    ] .
This enforces the constraint that identifiers are mandatory (which makes sense since they're derived from folder/file names) while respecting the existing DCMI definition of the property.

You just need to make sure you have the dcterms prefix defined:

turtle
@prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .
This approach is much cleaner than property redefinition and follows semantic web best practices (.85).




But the identifier is determined by folder/file name. What are the uses of putting that in RDF?

Edit
Good question (.75). The main uses would be:

1. SPARQL queries - "Find all nodes with identifier starting with 'user-'" without filesystem traversal

2. Cross-references - Other RDF resources can reference mesh resources by identifier in a standard way

3. Validation - Ensure identifier uniqueness across the mesh via SHACL

4. Integration - External systems can discover/reference mesh resources using standard DCMI properties

But you raise a valid point (.70) - if identifiers are always derivable from filesystem paths, storing them in RDF is redundant. The filesystem IS the authoritative source.

Arguments against:

Redundant with filesystem structure
Extra maintenance burden (keep RDF in sync)
Querying the filesystem might be just as efficient
Middle ground: Maybe only require dcterms:identifier for resources that need external referencing, not all MeshResources?

What's your intuition? Are you planning to do a lot of identifier-based querying, or would filesystem operations suffice for most use cases?




is identifier supposed to be local-only, or can it/should it be the full path?

Edit
Depends on the scope and use case (.70).

DCMI doesn't specify - dcterms:identifier can be local, global, or anything unique within the intended scope.

For your mesh architecture:

Local identifier (just folder/file name):

Pros: Simple, matches your "determined by folder name" description
Cons: Not unique across the entire mesh, needs context
Full path identifier:

Pros: Globally unique within mesh, enables cross-mesh references
Cons: Breaks if you move resources (hurts transposability goal?)
Hybrid approach (.80): Maybe local identifier in dcterms:identifier, but full path available via computed property or different property?

Given your mesh's emphasis on transposability, I'd lean toward local identifiers (.75) - the folder/file name that's intrinsic to the resource, not its location. This preserves meaning when nodes move around the mesh.

But this depends on your query patterns. Do you need to reference nodes from outside their immediate context? If so, you might need the full path for disambiguation.

What feels right for your use cases?




To refer to the Resource (i.e. cross-references), you'll need to use its identifier in the RDF. But I'm not sure how identifying the identifier helps anything. I suspect SPARQL can get the identifier somehow, we don't need to validate uniqueness. It's very confusing.

Edit
You're absolutely right, it is confusing (.85).

If you need the identifier to make cross-references in RDF (which makes sense), then it has to be IN the RDF. But beyond that use case, explicitly storing what's already derivable from filesystem structure does seem redundant.

The real question: Are you actually going to make cross-references between mesh resources in RDF? If yes, then you need identifiers in RDF. If mesh resources primarily reference each other through filesystem relationships rather than RDF properties, then maybe you don't.

Practical test: Can you think of a concrete example where one mesh resource would reference another via RDF property rather than filesystem structure? Something like:

turtle
:some-data-node :derivedFrom :other-data-node .
If you can't think of compelling cross-reference use cases, then maybe skip dcterms:identifier entirely (.70). You can always add it later when you discover you actually need it.

The filesystem already gives you all the identification and traversal you need for most mesh operations.




Are you sure we need identifiers to make cross-references? There will definitely be cross-references, but I don't know how explicit identifiers help.

Edit
You're right to question this (.80). I was conflating two different things:

Cross-references in RDF can happen via:

URIs/IRIs - the resource's address in RDF (like <http://example.org/nodes/user-123>)
Explicit identifier properties - separate dcterms:identifier "user-123" statements
You absolutely don't need explicit identifier properties for cross-references (.90). RDF resources can reference each other directly via their URIs:

turtle
:node-a :refersTo :node-b .
:node-b :derivedFrom :node-c .
The URI itself IS the identifier. Adding a separate dcterms:identifier property is just metadata about the resource, not necessary for linking.

So the question becomes: Do you need the folder/file name stored as explicit metadata for any other purpose? (.70) Discovery queries? External system integration? Or is the URI-based referencing sufficient?

Given your filesystem-centric design, I'm leaning toward "skip explicit identifiers" unless you find a specific need for them.




let's skip for now. Please review the ontology, cross-reference it for consistency with the documentation, and bring a plan for what's next.

Edit
I'll review your flow ontology and check it against our discussion. Let me read the current state first:

Review Summary
Overall Assessment: Your ontology is well-structured and cohesive (.85). The filesystem-RDF mapping is clear, and the class hierarchy makes sense for a mesh architecture.

Issues Found
1. Missing Abstract Class Constraints (.90)

Component should have SHACL shape - it's abstract but not constrained
Same pattern as ComponentLayer, DocumentationResource
2. Property Range Inconsistencies (.85)

hasReferenceComponent range is NodeComponent but should be ReferenceComponent
Same issue likely exists for other component properties
3. Missing Element Types in Disjointness (.80) The Element disjointness is missing Component:

turtle
[ a owl:AllDisjointClasses ;
    owl:members ( NodeHandle Component AssetTree DocumentationResource )
] .
4. Terminology Inconsistencies (.75)

Class is Component but SHACL refers to :NodeComponent
Labels sometimes say "node flow" vs "Component"
5. Missing FolderResource Constraint (.70) We discussed requiring ResourcePage for every FolderResource but it's not implemented.

Plan for Next Steps
Priority 1: Fix Property Ranges

turtle
hasReferenceComponent rdfs:range ReferenceComponent .
hasDataComponent rdfs:range DataComponent .
Priority 2: Add Missing SHACL

turtle
:ComponentShape a sh:NodeShape ;
    sh:targetClass :Component ;
    sh:not [ sh:class :Component ] ;
    sh:message "Component is abstract - use MetadataComponent, ReferenceComponent, or DataComponent" .
Priority 3: Update Disjointness Axioms

Priority 4: Consistent Terminology

Decide: "Component" or "node flow" in labels/comments
Fix SHACL target class references
Priority 5: Add FolderResource→ResourcePage constraint

Want me to make these fixes?




generate Component SHACL please, and no prefix colons.

Edit
turtle
:ComponentShape a sh:NodeShape ;
   sh:targetClass Component ;
   sh:not [ sh:class Component ] ;
   sh:message "Component is abstract - use MetadataComponent, ReferenceComponent, or DataComponent" .



Please check that they're fixed now.

Mostly fixed, but I found new issues (.80):

Fixed ✅
Component SHACL shape added correctly
Property ranges fixed (hasReferenceComponent → ReferenceComponent, etc.)
Element disjointness updated to include Component
Added Component types disjointness
No prefix colons in SHACL
Still Broken ❌
1. Syntax Error in FolderResourceShape (.95)

turtle
sh:propert [  # Missing 'y' - should be 'sh:property'
2. Missing Closing Period (.90) The FolderResourceShape is missing a closing .

3. Property Domain Issue (.75) hasComponentLayer domain is still NodeComponent but should be Component

4. Inconsistent Constraint (.70) FolderResourceShape says ResourcePage is optional (minCount 0) but we discussed it should be required for every FolderResource.

The syntax error will prevent the file from parsing correctly. Want me to provide the fixes for these remaining issues?




thanks, check again please, and then tell me how impressed you are.

Edit

read_file


How Impressed Am I?
Very impressed (.90).

What you got right:

Fixed all the syntax errors cleanly
Consistent SHACL pattern with no prefixes
Proper property ranges corrected
Clean disjointness axioms with logical groupings
Made FolderResource→ResourcePage mandatory (which makes sense for web-accessible filesystem)
Comprehensive constraints that actually enforce your mesh architecture
Remaining tiny issue (.95):

hasComponentLayer domain is still NodeComponent but the class is now Component
But honestly, this is a solid, well-structured ontology that clearly models a complex filesystem-based semantic architecture. The SHACL constraints are practical and enforce the invariants your system needs. The class hierarchy is clean and the multiple inheritance (FolderResource + specific types) maps nicely to your filesystem implementation.

This ontology actually captures something quite sophisticated - bridging RDF semantics with filesystem structure while maintaining flexibility. That's not trivial to model well, and you've done it cleanly (.85).

The "flow:" prefix suggestion in the comment is a nice touch for future users too.




Thanks for your help. What's next?

Edit
Immediate next steps (.85):

1. Fix that last domain issue

turtle
hasComponentLayer rdfs:domain Component ;  # not NodeComponent
2. Test it - Try loading this ontology into a reasoner/validator to catch any issues we missed (.80)

3. Create some example data - Build a small mesh instance that conforms to your ontology to validate the model works in practice

Medium-term priorities (.75):

4. Add missing relationships - You mentioned cross-references will definitely happen. As you discover the specific reference patterns, add those properties.

5. Extend layer semantics - The CurrentLayer→VersionLayer relationship (representsLayer) might need refinement as you implement the versioning workflow.

6. Consider provenance - When you start tracking who creates/modifies resources, you might want prov:wasGeneratedBy, dcterms:creator, etc.

7. Distribution modeling - How will you handle the actual RDF files (.ttl, .jsonld) within ComponentLayers? You might need to model those as dcat:Distributions.

Bigger picture (.70):

How does this ontology integrate with your broader semantic flow architecture?
Are there other ontologies/vocabularies you need to align with?
What tooling will consume this ontology?
What feels most pressing to you right now? Testing the current model, or extending it further?




After adding angle brackets everywhere, protege can open without problems. How do I run validation with protege?

Edit
Great that Protégé can load it! (.90) Here's how to run validation:

Built-in OWL Reasoning
1. Enable a reasoner:

Go to Reasoner menu → select HermiT, Pellet, or ELK
Click Start reasoner
Check the Reasoner tab for any inconsistencies or errors
2. Check for problems:

Look at the bottom status bar for error counts
Red highlighting indicates problems
Window → Tabs → Inconsistent classes to see conflicts
SHACL Validation
3. For SHACL validation (.75):

Protégé doesn't have great built-in SHACL support
You'll need the SHACL Plugin: Go to File → Check for plugins → search "SHACL"
Or use external tools like pySHACL or TopBraid
Quick validation commands (.80):
bash
# If you have pySHACL installed
pyshacl -s your-ontology.trig -df turtle

# Or use online validator
# Upload to https://shacl.org/playground/
4. Check the Protégé console (View → Show console) for detailed error messages.

The OWL reasoning should catch most structural issues. SHACL validation will test your constraints against actual data instances.

What errors (if any) is the reasoner showing?
