- one of the [[semantic flow elements|sflow.concepts.element]]
- used for attaching data to a [[sflow.concepts.mesh-node.semantic]]
- physically represented as a [[sflow.concepts.semantic-mesh.folder.ref]]
- logically represented as a [[sflow.concepts.sflow-dataset]] or [[related-topics.dcat.dataset-series]]
- not a [[sflow.concepts.mesh-node]], so doesn't have a [[sflow.concepts.element.catalog-dataset]]
