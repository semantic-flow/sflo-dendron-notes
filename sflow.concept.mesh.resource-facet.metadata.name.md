# Name Metadata (`_name/`)

## Overview

Name metadata captures the fundamental identity and naming concerns of a node. Names are philosophically and practically essential for bringing things into existence and enabling reference across systems.

## Philosophical Foundation

**Ontological Significance**: Names serve as the bridge between the abstract and concrete, giving identity to concepts and making them addressable within the mesh.

**Existence Through Naming**: The act of naming brings nodes into existence - without a name, there is no addressable entity in the mesh.

## Contents

### Identity and Authority
- **Naming authority**: Who designated/commissioned this name
- **Name governance**: Rules and permissions for name use and evolution
- **Authority chain**: Hierarchical relationships in naming decisions

### Name Relationships
- **sameAs assertions**: Equivalent names across different contexts
- **Aliases and variations**: Alternative forms and historical names
- **Name evolution**: Deprecations, redirects, and successors

### Network Effects
- **Backlinks/mentions**: Where this name is referenced across the mesh
- **Citation patterns**: How this name is used in different contexts
- **Cross-repository references**: External systems that recognize this name

### Provenance
- **Name origin**: When and why this name was created
- **Etymology**: Meaning and derivation of the name
- **Historical changes**: Timeline of name modifications

## Mandatory Nature

Every node requires name metadata because:
- **Addressability**: Names enable reference and navigation
- **Identity**: Names provide the fundamental identifier for the node
- **Coordination**: Names allow different systems to refer to the same entity

## Versioning

Name metadata evolves as:
- New mentions and backlinks are discovered
- Authority relationships change
- sameAs assertions are added or modified
- Name governance policies are updated
