Semantic flow refers to how meaning moves and connects through different contexts - whether in language, information systems, or cognitive processes. The concept appears across several domains with related but distinct applications.

In **linguistics and discourse analysis**, semantic flow describes how meaning develops and transitions across sentences, paragraphs, or entire texts. It's about the logical progression of ideas, how concepts build upon each other, and how readers or listeners follow the intended meaning. Good semantic flow ensures that each part of a text connects meaningfully to what comes before and after, creating coherence.

In **information architecture and user experience design**, semantic flow refers to how users navigate through information logically. It involves organizing content so that the conceptual relationships between different pieces of information are clear and intuitive. This might involve structuring a website's navigation, organizing database schemas, or designing interfaces where users can easily follow their intended path through information.

In **knowledge representation and AI systems**, semantic flow describes how meaning propagates through networks of concepts, relationships, and rules. This includes how semantic networks process information, how knowledge graphs connect related concepts, and how meaning flows through computational systems designed to understand and manipulate symbolic information.

In **cognitive science**, the term relates to how our minds process and connect meanings during thinking, reading, or problem-solving. It encompasses how we track themes across conversations, how we maintain coherent mental models, and how meaning flows through our associative networks of knowledge.

The common thread across these domains is the idea that meaning isn't static - it moves, transforms, and connects dynamically as we process information, whether we're reading a text, navigating a system, or thinking through a problem.
