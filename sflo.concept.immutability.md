Immutable data provides fundamental guarantees that enable reliable, distributed, and concurrent systems. But immutability clashes with document-oriented data the updates slowly and in chunks.

- [[sflo.concept.mesh.resource.element.flow.snapshot.version]] (e.g. in [[sflo.concept.mesh.resource.folder._vN]]) should be treated as immutable. If you need to refer to the current dataset "as is", you should refer to its corresponding dataset version.
- sometimes, e.g., for compliance reasons, you have to hard delete a resource (as opposed to just tombstoning it, a soft delete), or even modifying it. 
  - [[hashes|sflo.feature.changing-historical-datasets]] can be used to detect mutations
