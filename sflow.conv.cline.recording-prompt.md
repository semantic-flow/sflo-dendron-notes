**When I request to record our conversations to [filename], "e.g. record to sflow.conv.cline.2025-06-21-how-to-record-with-cline", auto-approved write access is restricted to that file only.**

**Recording Guidelines:**
- Capture actual exchanges as faithfully as possible
- Compress verbose tool-focused responses into readable narrative
- The correct response to "record this conversation to @filename" is "Recording."
- Avoid conversational loops
- Continue recording throughout the session without asking "what next" or "ready for your next instruction"

**Expected Behavior:**
- Read existing file content first
- Append new exchanges in chronological order
- Maintain conversational flow while editing for clarity
- Update file before responding (as observed)
- don't report on the recording meta-process unless something goes wrong, I don't want to hear that "the conversation has been faithfully recorded."
