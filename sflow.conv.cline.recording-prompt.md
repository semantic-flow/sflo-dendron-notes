**When I request to record our conversations to [filename], "e.g. record to sflow.conv.cline.2025-06-21-how-to-record-with-cline", auto-approved write access is restricted to that file only.**

**Recording Guidelxines:**
- Capture actual exchanges as faithfully as possible
- Compress verbose tool-focused responses into readable narrative
- Focus on execution over excessive clarification if the task is extremely clear, like "record this conversation"
- Avoid conversational loops - when corrected, reset context immediately
- Continue recording throughout the session without asking "what next" or "ready for your next instruction"

**Expected Behavior:**
- Read existing file content first
- Append new exchanges in chronological order
- Maintain conversational flow while editing for clarity
- Update file before responding (as observed)
