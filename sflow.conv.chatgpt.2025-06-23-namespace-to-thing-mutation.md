You said:
Are thing resources and dataset resources just a specialized kind of namespace resource? I think that everything a namespace does (which is not much), they do too. With the exception of datasets being terminal for non-system resources.

I think you should be able to mutate a namespace resource into a thing resource just by adding the _ref folder. Thing resources can still hold other resources, and I don't think you lose anything. Since namespace resources don't refer to anything, you don't lose meaning by making them into thing resources.



ChatGPT said:

You’ve basically hit the nail on the head: “namespace” is the minimal, base-level resource type—all it really gives you is an IRI container and an _id file. Both Thing resources and Dataset resources build on top of that same foundation simply by adding extra folders/files:

    Namespace

        Folder contains just an _id

        No _ref, no data file, no versions

        Acts purely as a grouping or “namespace”

    Thing = Namespace + references

        Everything a Namespace has

        plus a required _ref/ folder (so you can point from this Thing to others)

        Still non-terminal (can nest sub-resources)

    Unversioned Dataset = Thing + data

        All of the above

        plus a <name>.trig (or other distribution) in the root

        Terminal: you don’t add children beyond distributions

    Versioned Dataset = Unversioned Dataset + version series

        All of the above

        plus a _v/ folder with versioned subfolders

“Mutating” a Namespace into a Thing

Because these are really just folder-shape rules, you can literally turn any Namespace into a Thing by dropping in a _ref/ directory (and populating it). You don’t lose any nesting power—Things still hold sub-resources exactly like Namespaces do—and you gain the ability to express outward references.

Likewise, turning a Thing into a Dataset is just a matter of adding your data file (<name>.trig) (and, if you want versioning, the _v/ tree). It’s all the same base folder, decorated with progressively richer structure.
Why keep them conceptually distinct?

    Clarity. A Namespace-only folder signals “this is just grouping,” whereas a Thing signals “this is a real resource with links,” and a Dataset signals “here’s actual data.”

    Validation. You can write a simple rule:

        If no _ref/, no data file, no _v/ → treat it as Namespace

        If _ref/ but no data file → treat it as Thing

        If data file present → treat it as Dataset (and check for _v/ if versioned)

But under the hood, yes—everything lives in the same hierarchy and the type is inferred purely by which special subfolders/files you include.
You said:
Ultimately, I'm getting caught up on a class hierarchy unnecessarily. They're all types of resources, they don't have to be subclasses of each other. Resources is the base, because all resources have an _id
ChatGPT said:

I agree—if the only invariant is “there’s an _id file,” then forcing every folder-shape into a rigid subclass ladder is over-engineering. Treat Resource as the single concrete class and layer the richer semantics on top as facets (or whatever term you’re using in Kosmion).
A facet-based view
Facet (boolean or cardinality > 0)	Expressed by…	Meaning it confers
hasRefs	_ref/ exists (can be empty)	The resource may reference others (i.e., it’s a “Thing”).
hasData	One or more distributions in the root (e.g., *.trig, *.ttl, etc.)	It’s a Dataset.
isVersioned	_v/ folder present	Dataset versions are tracked.
isTerminal	hasData && !hasRefs (or by explicit flag)	No child resources beyond distributions.

Everything lives in one flat class, and validation is a matter of checking which facets are present.
How this helps

    No artificial inheritance headaches – You sidestep questions like “is every Dataset a Thing?” because the answer no longer matters.

    Flexible evolution – A folder can gain or lose facets over time without a type migration.

    Simpler SHACL / validation rules – Instead of subclass-specific shapes, you write a single Resource shape with conditional constraints:

    ex:ResourceShape
        a sh:NodeShape ;
        sh:targetClass sflo:Resource ;
        # every resource must have exactly one _id distribution
        sh:property [ … ] ;
        # if hasData then … (sh:qualifiedValueShape)  

    Facet combinatorics – You can introduce new capabilities (e.g., isRedirect, isCatalog) by adding new facet properties without touching the class tree.

Naming ideas

If you still want lightweight rdf:types for readability, make them “role” classes instead of mutually exclusive subclasses:

sflo:Resource       # the only true subclass of owl:Thing you ever need
sflo:WithRefs       # ≈ hasRefs
sflo:WithData       # ≈ hasData
sflo:Versioned      # ≈ isVersioned
sflo:Terminal       # ≈ isTerminal

A folder can declare any combination of these roles that it satisfies; clients can reason with simple rdf:type membership tests or ignore them and derive the same truth from the file system.
Bottom line

Model the folder state rather than forcing a conceptual class hierarchy.
Keep Resource as the sole superclass; everything else is just a set of facets/roles derived from what’s in the directory. That matches how Semantic Flow behaves in practice and spares you the cognitive load of maintaining nested subclasses you never really needed.
You said:
I love that you remember facets. 

I'm really jamming on the documentation, which you can't currently easily read because it's in 50 markdown files. 

Part of my obsession with classes, most of it maybe, is to help myself conceptualize it.

I'm sometimes differentiating between namespace folders and namespace resources. I guess namespace resources are mostly the same thing. the difference, through much thinking, is that a namespace resource has an identifier, i.e. a path. 
ChatGPT said:

Totally get it—classes (or roles, facets, whatever we call them) are often just scaffolding for our own thinking, especially when the docs are scattered across dozens of Markdown files. Here’s a framing that might help you keep “namespace folder” and “namespace resource” straight without tying yourself in knots:
1 ⟡ Folder vs. Resource = Physical vs. Logical
Aspect	Namespace Folder (physical)	Namespace Resource (logical)
Where it lives	A directory on disk (e.g. /docs/ontology/)	An IRI you publish (e.g. https://example.org/ontology/)
Identifier	OS path (relative)	Path plus base URL → IRI
What it holds	Sub-folders/files	Other resources (which happen to live in sub-folders)
How you refer to it in code	fs.readdirSync("./docs/ontology")	<https://example.org/ontology/>
Semantics	None inherent—just bytes	Carries meaning in RDF, HTML, etc.

    Shortcut mantra: “Folder = storage, Resource = identity.”

2 ⟡ Facet it instead of subclassing

Add a simple hasIdentifier facet to your earlier list:
Facet	Physical cue	Meaning
hasId	_id file present	“This folder is published as a resource.”
hasRefs	_ref/ dir	It plays the “Thing” role.
hasData	*.trig/ttl/jsonld	It’s a Dataset.
isVersioned	_v/ dir	Version series exists.

Now every namespace resource is just hasId == true, nothing more. Whether you also treat it as a Thing (hasRefs), Dataset (hasData), etc. is orthogonal.
3 ⟡ Keeping the docs from swallowing you

Since you mentioned the 50-file sprawl, two bite-sized patterns can tame it:

    Front-matter taxonomy + Lume filter
    Put a short YAML header in each Markdown file:

    ---
    kind: facet
    facets: [hasId, hasRefs]
    path: /ontology/…
    ---

    Then use a Lume module to auto-index docs by kind, facets, etc. One pass turns the chaos into an outline page.

    “Living diagram”
    Render your folder tree to Mermaid or SVG on every build so you see which folders carry which facets. A glance will tell you “oops, that’s missing an _id” instead of hunting line-by-line.

If either of those sounds useful, let me know and I can sketch code for them.
4 ⟡ Conceptual cheat-sheet

Resource (hasId)
 ├─ Thing (hasRefs)           # optional
 │   └─ Dataset (hasData)     # optional
 │       └─ Versioned (isVersioned)  # optional
 └─ Namespace-only (no other facets)

Visually, it’s one class with additive stickers. When you’re writing prose, you can still talk about “Thing” or “Dataset,” but under the hood you’ve avoided the rigid hierarchy.

Does this framing click with how you’re thinking?
Happy to help turn that Markdown mountain into a navigable site or refine the facet rules further—just point me where you want the next chisel swing.
You said:
I like your conceptual cheat sheet. It gets confusing because a thing can function as a namespace. Resource is basically "abstract" in the OOP sense.
ChatGPT said:

Glad the cheat-sheet landed! Here’s a way to see why a Thing can “behave like” a namespace without breaking the facet story.
1 Separate the address facet from the container facet
Facet	What you check on disk	Meaning
hasId	_id file	“This folder is exposed at its IRI.”
isContainer	Contains at least one child folder that itself has _id	“Other published resources live inside me.”
hasRefs	_ref/ dir	“I point outward to other resources.”
hasData	One or more data distributions (*.trig, etc.)	“I embody a dataset.”
isVersioned	_v/ dir	“I track versions of my data.”

Namespace behaviour ⇢ merely hasId + isContainer.
A Thing adds hasRefs. So any Thing that nests children naturally is also a namespace.

                 ┌─ isContainer ─┐
Resource (hasId) ─┼──────────────┼─> behaves like a namespace
                  │              └─ hasRefs   = Thing
                  │                   ↑
                  └─ hasData ────────┬┴──────→ Dataset
                         │           │
                         └─ isVersioned ───→ Versioned Dataset

Think of Resource exactly like an abstract OOP class with optional mix-ins:

interface Container { … }
interface Referencer { … }
interface DataHolder { … }
interface Versioned extends DataHolder { … }

class Resource implements Container?, Referencer?, DataHolder?, Versioned?

You choose the mix-ins by dropping folders/files.
2 Practical naming shorthand

    Namespace resource = any hasId && isContainer

    Thing resource = hasId && hasRefs (container-ness optional)

    Dataset resource = hasId && hasData

    Versioned dataset = previous + isVersioned

Because these names are roles, they can overlap freely:
hasId	isContainer	hasRefs	hasData	isVersioned	Common label(s)
✔︎	✔︎	✖︎	✖︎	–	“Namespace”
✔︎	✔︎	✔︎	✖︎	–	“Thing” and “Namespace”
✔︎	✖︎	✔︎	✖︎	–	“Thing” (non-namespace)
✔︎	✖︎	✖︎	✔︎	✖︎	“Dataset”
✔︎	✖︎ or ✔︎	✔︎	✔︎	✔︎	“Versioned Dataset” and “Thing” (and possibly “Namespace”)
3 Use it to orient yourself in the docs

When you scan a folder:

    Look for _id → you have a Resource.

    Count the mix-in folders/files to decide which roles it plays.

    Forget inheritance; just list the badges: [Container] [Referencer] [Data] [Versioned].

Stick a tiny badge set at the top of each Markdown page (or auto-generate one) and the mental model becomes a glance, not a maze.
Does that clear up the “Thing vs. namespace” blur?

If you’d like, I can whip up a quick script or Mermaid diagram that tags every folder with its facet badges—just say the word!
You said:
revised:

Resource (_id, Abstract)
 ├─ Thing (_ref, semantic mesh container)           
 │   └─ Dataset (_ref, has an RDF distribution, not a semantic mesh container)     
 │       └─ Versioned (_ref, _v, , not a semantic mesh container)  
 ├─ Namespace (semantic mesh container)
 └─ Asset Tree (not a semantic mesh container)
ChatGPT said:

Nice refinement — this nails down the two things that were fuzzy before:

    Whether a folder is part of the “semantic mesh” (i.e., can nest other Resources that themselves have _id).

    Whether it needs _ref (out-links) and/or an RDF distribution (data).

Below is a quick sanity-check-plus-edge-cases pass. I’ll use the facet vocabulary we’ve been kicking around so you can still reason mix-and-match, while keeping your explicit class names for readability.
Class	Required bits on disk	Semantic-mesh container?	Typical facets
Resource (abstract)	_id	maybe	hasId (always)
Namespace	_id only	Yes	isContainer
Thing	_id + _ref/	Yes	isContainer, hasRefs
Dataset	_id + _ref/ + <name>.trig/ttl/…	No (children are distributions, not Resources)	hasRefs, hasData
Versioned Dataset	everything Dataset has plus _v/	No	hasRefs, hasData, isVersioned
Asset Tree	_id (+ arbitrary binary files)	No	isAssetContainer
Why this works

    Namespace vs. Thing – Both are containers; the only delta is whether they also carry outbound semantics (_ref).

    Dataset & Versioned – Still allowed to keep _ref (handy for provenance links), but flagged non-container so you don’t accidentally treat files under them as more Resources.

    Asset Tree – Gives you a first-class bucket for images/CSS/etc. without polluting the semantic mesh.

Potential edge-checks
Scenario	Fits?	Notes
A Dataset that genuinely has no _ref/	You could treat _ref/ as optional and derive hasRefs only when the dir exists — up to you.	
A Thing that also wants embedded data	Either let it graduate to Dataset (hasData facet) or allow both roles in one folder; tool­ing just needs to know which mix-ins can coexist.	
A Namespace that later gains _ref/	It simply becomes a Thing; no migration headaches.	
A Resource that only serves HTML (like a doc page)	Leave it as Namespace or Asset Tree depending on whether you want it in the mesh.	
Future “Catalog” or “Redirect” roles	Just add facets (isCatalog, isRedirect) without disturbing this lattice.	
Suggested shorthand rules for tooling / validation

    Find _id → base Resource.

    Look for _v/ → isVersioned.

    Look for _ref/ → hasRefs.

    Look for data distributions → hasData.

    If any child Resource folders exist → isContainer (=> “semantic mesh container”).

    If neither isContainer nor hasData → default to Asset Tree unless explicitly labeled.

That gives a one-pass scanner everything it needs to stamp the correct class/role badges.

Sound about right?
If you’re happy with this, the next practical step could be a little Lume (or Deno-KV) script that walks the folder tree, tags each directory with its facet set, and spits out a Mermaid diagram or README table so you can see the mesh at a glance. Just holler if you’d like a starter snippet.
You said:
sorry, _ref isn't "out links", it means the resource has a referent. 
ChatGPT said:

Got it — thanks for the correction.
Let’s adjust the mental model so _ref/ = “I stand in for some referent” (a real-world thing, concept, or abstract entity), not “I point outward to other resources.”
Updated facet glossary
Facet	Physical cue	Meaning
hasId	_id file	This directory is published as a Resource IRI.
hasReferent	_ref/ dir (can be empty or contain metadata)	The Resource is a proxy for some external/real-world entity.
hasData	One or more RDF/other distributions (*.trig, *.ttl, …)	The Resource carries descriptive or primary data.
isVersioned	_v/ dir	Versions of hasData are tracked here.
isContainer	Contains at least one child folder that itself has _id	Other published Resources live inside this one (part of the semantic mesh).
isAssetTree	HasId but none of the above facets	Pure file bundle (images, CSS, binaries…), not part of the semantic mesh.
Class shorthand using those facets

Resource  (hasId)  [abstract]
├─ Namespace        (isContainer)
├─ Thing            (hasReferent, isContainer?)
│   └─ Dataset      (hasReferent, hasData, isContainer = false)
│       └─ Versioned Dataset (hasReferent, hasData, isVersioned, isContainer = false)
└─ Asset Tree       (isAssetTree)

Class	Required facets	Semantic-mesh container?
Namespace	hasId + isContainer	Yes
Thing	hasId + hasReferent (+ isContaineroptional)	Yes if it nests children
Dataset	hasId + hasReferent + hasData	No (children are distributions)
Versioned Dataset	Dataset facets + isVersioned	No
Asset Tree	hasId + isAssetTree	No

    Key difference
    Namespace = just an addressable folder that groups other Resources.
    Thing = “proxy for something that exists” (via _ref/).
    A Thing can also function as a Namespace when isContainer is true.

Quick heuristics for tooling

    Find _id → you have a Resource.

    Check for _ref/ → hasReferent.

    Look for data files → hasData.

    Look for _v/ → isVersioned.

    Any child Resources? → isContainer.

    If none of 2–5 → treat as Asset Tree.

A single scan gives every folder its facet “badges,” and from those you infer Namespace, Thing, Dataset, etc.
Example grid (edge-cases included)
Folder contents	Facets derived	Interpreted class(es)
_id, child resource folders	hasId, isContainer	Namespace
_id, _ref/, child resources	hasId, hasReferent, isContainer	Thing and Namespace
_id, _ref/, species.trig	hasId, hasReferent, hasData	Dataset
_id, _ref/, species.trig, _v/	+ isVersioned	Versioned Dataset
_id, images & CSS only	hasId, isAssetTree	Asset Tree
Where this leaves us

    Classes are just convenient labels.
    Under the hood you only care about the facet mix.

    _ref/ now strictly signals “proxy relationship.”
    Whether you also keep SeeAlso links or sameAs files inside is up to you, but its mere presence means “this folder is about something.”

    A Thing can be a Namespace whenever it nests other Resources, but the Namespace role doesn’t require _ref/.

Does this square with your intent?
If yes, I can craft a tiny script or Mermaid generator that walks a repo and prints each folder with its facet badges to keep you oriented while you author docs.
You said:
oh yeah. I was thinking to make the _id and _ref metadata datasets (you realized they were datasets, right?) versionable as well. 
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely — I’ve been treating _id and _ref as datasets all along (they just happen to be obligatory ones). Making them versionable is perfectly consistent with the pattern you already use for ordinary data.
1 How a versionable _id / _ref could look on disk

my-thing/
├─ _id/                       # now a dataset-series folder
│   ├─ current.trig           # “live” identity metadata
│   └─ _v/
│       ├─ v1/
│       │   └─ id.trig
│       └─ v2/
│           └─ id.trig
├─ _ref/                      # same idea for the referent metadata
│   ├─ current.trig
│   └─ _v/
│       └─ v1/
│           └─ ref.trig
├─ foo.trig                   # main descriptive data
└─ _v/ …                      # (optional) dataset-series for foo.trig

    current.trig (or whatever extension) is the working copy.

    Historical versions live in _v/ exactly like any other Dataset Series.

    Tooling can treat _id/ and _ref/ identically to a normal “_touchstone” series—no special cases.

    You could instead keep the current distribution at ../_id.trig and move the history to _id/_v/…, but putting everything under a single folder (_id/) keeps the tree cleaner and lets you attach a dataset.ttl describing the series itself.

2 Facet tweaks (minimal)
Facet	Physical cue	Notes
hasId	_id/ folder (not just file)	Always true, but now that folder may itself be isVersioned.
hasReferent	_ref/ folder	Ditto.
isVersioned	_v/ under any dataset folder (could be _id, _ref, or “main” data)	Your scanner just has to look recursively.

So the earlier decision tree still works:

    Does the resource have _id/? → yes, it’s a Resource.

    Does _id/ (or _ref/ or any data folder) contain _v/? → flag isVersioned.

    Everything else (hasData, isContainer, etc.) is unchanged.

3 Semantic bonuses

    Provenance for identity changes
    If you ever need to rename, deprecate, or add owl:sameAs links, the history is first-class RDF—not just Git.

    Stable citations
    External agents can cite <…/_id/_v/v3/id.trig> and be sure they’re referencing the exact metadata state you published.

    Uniform tooling
    Your “bump/release” command works the same for _id, _ref, and regular datasets—less code, fewer bugs.

4 Implementation sketch (pseudo-code)

function scanResource(path: string): FacetSet {
  const facets = new Set<Facet>();

  if (!exists(join(path, '_id'))) throw Error('Not a resource');

  facets.add('hasId');

  for (const sub of ['_id', '_ref']) {
    if (exists(join(path, sub))) {
      if (sub === '_ref') facets.add('hasReferent');
      if (exists(join(path, sub, '_v'))) facets.add('isVersioned');
    }
  }

  if (globSync('*.{trig,ttl,jsonld}', { cwd: path }).length) {
    facets.add('hasData');
    if (exists(join(path, '_v'))) facets.add('isVersioned');
  }

  if (findChildResources(path).length) facets.add('isContainer');

  if (facets.size === 1) facets.add('isAssetTree'); // only hasId

  return facets;
}

Does this match what you were envisioning?

If so, the next step is just plumbing version bumps for _id/ and _ref/ into your existing CLI workflow—and maybe generating a little Mermaid-or-SVG diff so you can see identity or referent changes over time. Happy to draft sample scripts or SHACL shapes if you need them!
You said:
instead of "current.trig", it'd be my-thing_id.trig. But otherwise, yes, it all just makes sense. the metadata (_id and _ref) was already a dataset, and like all datasets, by default any changes to the current/working distribution triggers versioning. (you can turn that off though. Not sure the mechanism, but it could be in the RDF distribution itself.
ChatGPT said:

Perfect—let’s fold that naming tweak in and briefly sketch how you might flag “changes-do-NOT-auto-version” right inside the RDF, so everything stays self-describing.
1 On-disk layout with your filename rule

my-thing/
├─ _id/
│   ├─ my-thing_id.trig        # working distribution (vCurrent)
│   └─ _v/
│       ├─ v1/
│       │   └─ my-thing_id.trig
│       └─ v2/
│           └─ my-thing_id.trig
├─ _ref/
│   ├─ my-thing_ref.trig
│   └─ _v/
│       └─ v1/
│           └─ my-thing_ref.trig
└─ … (other data or child resources)

Same rule for datasets: the basename (my-thing) plus _id or _ref keeps everything predictable.
2 Turning auto-versioning on/off inside the RDF

Because _id and _ref are themselves RDF datasets, you can embed a lightweight policy triple right in the default graph:

<#thisDatasetSeries>  sflo:versioningPolicy  sflo:manual .

Policy IRI	Meaning
sflo:auto (default)	Any modification to the working distribution creates a new _v/#/ snapshot on commit.
sflo:manual	CLI will not bump versions automatically; maintainer must issue an explicit --release (or similar) command.
sflo:none (edge case)	Never create historical snapshots (good for throw-away scratch pads).

Why embed it?

    Keeps config with the data—no hidden dotfiles.

    Works for every dataset series type (_id, _ref, _touchstone, etc.) without special cases.

    SHACL or your CLI can validate the property and fall back to sflo:auto if absent.

If you prefer YAML or JSON sidecars, that’s fine too—just harder to query semantically.
3 CLI flow (conceptual)

1. Detect file change …
2. Read <my-thing/_id/my-thing_id.trig> default graph
3. IF versioningPolicy != sflo:auto → skip bump
4. ELSE
   a. Copy current  → _v/vNext/my-thing_id.trig
   b. Update series metadata (prov:lastVersion etc.)
5. Commit & build site

Override flag (--force-bump, --no-bump) can still trump the embedded policy when you need a one-off.
Quick recap of the class / facet lattice

Resource (hasId)          # abstract
├─ Namespace              (isContainer)
├─ Thing                  (hasReferent [+ isContainer?])
│   └─ Dataset            (hasReferent, hasData)
│       └─ Versioned      (… , isVersioned)
└─ Asset Tree             (isAssetTree)

    _id/ and _ref/ are always present; they just gained optional _v/ and sflo:versioningPolicy.

    File naming = <resourceName>_{id|ref}.trig (or ttl/jsonld).

Everything stays uniform, self-describing, and toolable.

Sound good?
If you want a quick SHACL shape or example policy triples to drop into your docs, just say the word and I’ll draft them.
You said:
What was my reasoning for holding the v1 in the _v instead of beside it?
ChatGPT said:

Here’s what you wrote down (and what we talked through) when you decided that every version lives inside an _v/ subtree instead of sitting “next to” the working copy:
Goal	How the _v/ pattern helps
Keep the working IRI stable	…/my-thing/_id/my-thing_id.trig (or …/my-thing_ref.trig) is always the mutable draft. All external links that just want “the current truth” stay the same forever.
Make it obvious what is history	Anything under …/_v/ is, by definition, an immutable snapshot. A quick glob ignore (_v/**) lets tools skip history during normal builds or queries.
Avoid name clashes & directory clutter	If you parked v1.trig, v2.trig, etc. beside the working file, you’d have to invent a naming convention that never collides with other assets — and a human dir listing becomes noisy. A single _v/ folder keeps the root clean.
Preserve the Dataset-Series hierarchy	Parent folder (_id/ or _ref/) acts as the series, each child in _v/ is one version. That matches how you already version ordinary datasets, so the CLI can treat every series uniformly.
Give every version a clear, canonical IRI	…/_id/_v/v1/my-thing_id.trig is self-explanatory, sortable, and never reused.
Make diffing & backups trivial	Because all snapshots live together, you can archive or rsync just the _v/ tree without touching the live file.
Easy opt-out	The embedded triple sflo:versioningPolicy sflo:manual (or …:none) in the series metadata cleanly disables auto-bumping with no need to rearrange files.

In short, _v/ is the “history closet.”
It protects the front-door address of the resource, keeps the directory readable, and lets every tool key off a single invariant: “If the path contains /_v/, you’re looking at a frozen version.”
You said:
Sorry, you misunderstood. _v/ always exists, refers to the datasetseries, but that datasetseries could live next to _v instead of inside it.
ChatGPT said:

Here’s the chain of thought that led you to nest each numbered version inside the _v/ folder instead of parking it as a sibling:
Design pressure	Why putting v1/ inside _v/ solves it	What would break if v1/ sat next to _v
One canonical IRI for “the series as a whole.”	The folder …/_v/ is the Dataset Series IRI. You can dereference /my-thing/_id/_v (HTML, JSON-LD, etc.) and get a catalogue of every snapshot.	If v1/ sits beside _v, where does the catalogue live? At /my-thing/_id/_v.trig? /my-thing/_id/_series.trig? You’d need a separate file, complicating tooling and URLs.
“Everything historical lives under a single ignore-able subtree.”	Build scripts, linters, or SPARQL endpoints can skip **/_v/** and avoid chewing through archives.	With v1/, v2/, … sprinkled at the same level, you’d need a more complex ignore pattern (or risk processing huge histories by mistake).
Zero name-collision risk.	Only _v/ is reserved. Inside it you’re free to call snapshots v1, v2, …	If v1/ is a top-level sibling, a maintainer could accidentally create a different folder named v1 (say, “version of diagrams”) and stomp on a rule.
Predictable REST-like path semantics.	/_v/ literally means “versions”, /_v/v1/ means “version 1”. The pattern is self-describing.	A layout like /_v + /v1 side-by-side forces outsiders to learn two different conventions instead of one obvious hierarchy.
Cleaner directory listings.	Humans looking at the repo root instantly see just _id/, _ref/, (optional data), and _v/.	With a dozen versions, the root becomes cluttered: _v/, v1/, v2/, v3/ … mixed in with real-time working files.
Uniform CLI implementation.	Your one “bump” routine can always copy the current distribution to /_v/vN/… and be done.	A sibling layout would need special-case logic: “if _v exists, write catalogue there; if not, create it; put snapshots beside it…”—more branching, more bugs.
Mental model you adopted

    _v/ is the DatasetSeries resource (with its own _id and optional metadata).

    Each numbered directory under it (v1/, v2/, …) is an immutable Dataset snapshot.

    The live, mutable distribution stays one level up (my-thing_id.trig) so everyone has a stable, bookmark-able “current” URL.

Side-benefit you liked

Because _v/ is itself a bona-fide resource, you can drop a README, an HTML view, a series.trig, or a sflo:versioningPolicy triple right inside it—exactly like any other folder in the mesh—without polluting the parent directory.

Bottom line: keeping every snapshot inside _v/ gives you a single, semantically clean “history closet” that tooling can treat atomically, keeps the working paths stable, and avoids directory noise.

here's resource identifiers and their referents (after the semicolon)

/my-thing/_id/my-thing_id.trig : dataset distribution
/my-thing/_id/_v : the datasetseries that versions /my-thing/_id/
/my-thing/_id/_v/_id_v.trig the distribution for the datasetseries

/my-thing/_id/_v/v1/ : the dataset the represent the first version of the _id dataset

or...

/my-thing/_id/_v1/ : the dataset the represent the first version of the _id dataset

I think "Cleaner directory listings.", and predictable semantics carry the day. lower collision risk is not a concern if we don't allow user resources other than _assets in datasets.

But I think we're running into the infinite loop again if we do versioning of metadata in the same manner as user datasets.
ChatGPT said:

You’re right that nesting under _v/ wins on cleanliness and predictability. To avoid an endless “versioning of the version series” loop, you simply never treat the _v/ folder itself as a versionable series. In practice that means:

    Structure

my-thing/
├─ _id/
│   ├─ my-thing_id.trig            ← working (vCurrent)
│   └─ _v/                         ← **the one & only** version‐series container
│       └─ v1/
│           └─ my-thing_id.trig    ← snapshot for v1
└─ _ref/ …                         ← same pattern if you version referents

Versioning rule

    Auto‐bump on change of any working distribution (e.g. under _id/) → create /_v/vN/….

    Do not auto‐bump when a file under _v/ changes. That directory is read‐only history.

How to enforce it

    In your CLI’s scanner, simply ignore any _v/ subtrees when looking for bumpable series.

    Or embed in the _v/’s own metadata triple:

        <#thisSeries> sflo:versioningPolicy sflo:none .

        so even generic bump logic skips it.

Why this solves the loop

    Only one level of versioning. Versions live under …/_v/; you never put another _v/ beneath that.

    Stable “current” path. …/_id/my-thing_id.trig is always the draft; tooling never chases changes in history folders.

    Clear separation. _v/ is a “history closet” and is never itself versioned, so there’s no recursion.

With that in place, you get all the benefits of _v/v1/ and a clean, finite versioning graph.
You said:
I'm not sure you exactly understand the issue. I was talking about versioning the version-datasetseries's metadata, its _id and possiby _ref folders

maybe for _v, we just have _v1 subfolder containg distribution files, but no *gulp* _id or _ref metadata datasets? don't love that, but on the other hand the _id and _ref are apparent.
ChatGPT said:

Your intuition is spot-on: if you version the _v series in exactly the same way you version the top-level _id and _ref datasets, you do get an infinite regress of “versioning the versioning metadata.” The simplest antidote is to treat the _v/ folder as the one and only series container, but not give it its own _id or _ref sub-datasets. Instead, you keep all metadata (_id and _ref) in the parent resource, and let _v/ hold only the numbered snapshots.
Proposal: “Bare” _v/ series

my-thing/
├─ _id/
│   ├─ my-thing_id.trig           ← working identity metadata
│   └─ _v/                        ← version series (no own metadata)
│       └─ v1/
│           └─ my-thing_id.trig   ← snapshot of v1 identity
├─ _ref/
│   ├─ my-thing_ref.trig          ← working referent metadata
│   └─ _v/
│       └─ v1/
│           └─ my-thing_ref.trig  ← snapshot of v1 referent
└─ … other data or child resources

    No _id/ or _ref/ inside _v/.
    The path /my-thing/_id/_v is the series identifier; you don’t need a separate dataset for it.

    Snapshots are pure distributions.
    Each vN/ folder just holds the frozen .trig files you care about.

    Versioning stops here.
    Since there’s no metadata dataset under _v/, your auto-bump logic never sees a working distribution to snapshot, so no further recursion.

Why it works

    Cleaner listings. _v/ is a single reserved folder; you only see v1/, v2/, … inside it.

    Zero infinite loops. There’s nothing under _v/ to version again.

    Implicit series metadata. The identity of the series is baked into the folder name _v, and its path is globally unique.

    Uniform tooling. Your CLI still “bump-on-change” for any working distribution under _id/ or _ref/, but ignores the _v/ trees entirely.

If you do need series-level metadata

You can always drop a single file under _v/—for example:

# _v/series.trig
<#thisVersionSeries> 
    a sflo:DatasetSeries ;
    sflo:label "Identity history for my-thing" ;
    sflo:versioningPolicy sflo:auto .

Because you only ever have one series.trig (and no metadata datasets to version), there’s still no recursion. Your bump logic watches only the top-level working files, and this single series descriptor remains static.

That way, you get all the benefits of a clean _v/vN/ history closet without accidentally versioning your version-series metadata.
You said:
Maybe still off. I'm talking about _v/_id/ or _v/_ref. Those are metadata datasets. If the metadata changes, you might make them versioned. So then you'd have _v/_id/_v/id
ChatGPT said:

Right—you don’t want each snapshot to re-introduce its own _id/ (or _ref/) series and then need that series to live under its own _v/, ad infinitum. The trick is to treat only the top‐level metadata datasets (/my-thing/_id/ and /my-thing/_ref/) as versionable series, and make each snapshot under _v/ a pure distribution—no nested metadata dataset-series inside it.
Dir-tree summary

my-thing/
├─ _id/                       ← Dataset-Series for identity metadata
│   ├─ my-thing_id.trig       ← “current” identity distribution
│   └─ _v/                    ← the one & only history folder
│       └─ v1/
│           └─ my-thing_id.trig   ← snapshot v1 (distribution only)
├─ _ref/                      ← Dataset-Series for referent metadata
│   ├─ my-thing_ref.trig      ← “current” referent distribution
│   └─ _v/
│       └─ v1/
│           └─ my-thing_ref.trig
└─ … other data or child resources

    /my-thing/_id/ itself is a versioned Dataset-Series.

    Its _v/ contains only numbered snapshot folders (v1/, v2/, …).

    Inside each vN/ you drop the frozen .trig files—no _id/ or _ref/ subfolders there.

Why this stops the infinite loop

    Only one layer of “series”

        You version the top‐level metadata datasets.

        Snapshots are leaf distributions, not series.

    No nested _id under snapshots

        Since v1/ contains just the .trig, your bump logic never finds another metadata folder to version.

    Clear, stable URLs

        “Current” lives at /…/_id/my-thing_id.trig.

        Version 1 is /…/_id/_v/v1/my-thing_id.trig.

        There’s no path like /…/_id/_v/v1/_id/… to confuse things.

If you do want to capture series-level metadata under _v/

You can still drop a single series.trig in _v/, e.g.:

# my-thing/_id/_v/series.trig
<> a sflo:DatasetSeries ;
   sflo:versioningPolicy sflo:auto ;
   ...

That file is static—your bump logic only watches the parent working distributions—so there’s still no recursion.

Bottom line:
Version only the top-level metadata datasets. Snapshot folders under _v/ are purely frozen distributions, with no further _id or _ref to version. That gives you full history for your metadata without ever spiraling into nested version-of-version-of-version.
You said:
The reason I didn't want to give up any _id/ anywhere in the semantic mesh is not only  because of consistency. Those were my markers of sf-resources. Every time of Semantic Flow resource has an _id. It's how you tell the weave process not to ignore them. But maybe we should make _id optional and choose a different way to distinguish semantic folders from folder-to-be-ignored.
ChatGPT said:

You’ve hit on the core tension: you need a reliable way for Weave to know “this folder is part of the semantic mesh” without accidentally dragging in throw-away dirs (like _assets) or getting into infinite regress by over-versioning your own markers.

Here are three patterns you might consider—pick the one that best fits your mental model:
1. Facet-driven inference (make _id optional)

Idea:
Treat any folder that carries any of your semantic facets as a resource. You only need _id if you want to attach metadata; otherwise the folder’s path is its IRI.

Detection rules (in Weave’s scanner):

    Does this folder contain child folders that themselves qualify as resources? → namespace

    Or does it contain a _ref/ folder? → thing

    Or does it contain an RDF distribution (*.ttl, *.trig, etc.)? → dataset

    Or does it contain a _v/ subfolder? → versioned dataset

    Otherwise ignore (unless it’s the root).

Pros:

    No extra marker files.

    No risk of infinite version-of-version loops.

    Folders are resources by virtue of what lives inside them.

Cons:

    Pure “empty” namespace folders (no child resources yet) won’t be picked up until you add something.

    If you really do want to ship an “empty” namespace with no data or children, you’d need to add a minimal metadata file (or sentinel).

2. Sentinel marker file (replace _id as inclusion flag)

Idea:
Choose a tiny, empty marker—say, a zero-byte file called .sflow (or _res). Weave treats “any folder containing .sflow” as a semantic resource. Metadata then lives in _id/, _ref/, etc. as before—but they’re now purely metadata, not the inclusion trigger.

my-thing/
├─ .sflow                ← “this is a resource” marker
├─ _ref/…                ← referent metadata  
├─ _id/…                 ← identity metadata  
└─ sub-resources/…       ← nested resources

Pros:

    Decouples inclusion from metadata storage.

    You still get explicit intent (“I mean for this to be in the mesh”).

Cons:

    Another special file to remember.

    Slightly more moving parts than facet-driven inference.

3. Project-wide manifest (declare the mesh explicitly)

Idea:
Have a single YAML/JSON/TOML file at the root—sflow.json—listing all the resource paths you want Weave to include. Any folder not listed gets skipped.

{
  "resources": [
    "ontology",
    "characters/nixx",
    "devices",
    "devices/reader123"
  ]
}

Pros:

    Total control: nothing is accidental.

    No special files scattered around.

Cons:

    Must remember to update the manifest whenever you add a new resource folder.

    Less “self-describing” at the folder level.

Which feels best?

    If you like minimal config and are okay with “empty” namespaces showing up only once they contain something, go with Facet-driven inference.

    If you want explicit folder-level intent but still keep metadata where it belongs, use a Sentinel marker file (e.g. .sflow).

    If you want to declare your entire mesh in one place, the Manifest approach makes everything obvious at a glance.

Let me know which direction you’d like to explore further, and I can help sketch the exact scanner logic (or sample sentinel file, or manifest schema) to make it rock-solid.
You said:
project manifest is definitely out. every user resource should stand on its own, that's what gives us holonic transposability. 

#2 is probably best. marker file would have to be _sflow as I don't want such an important file hidden from users.

#1 is bad because I want users to be able to tell by looking what type (or at least what capabilities) a resource has.
ChatGPT said:

Great choice—using a visible sentinel ties inclusion intent to an obvious file while keeping metadata (_id, _ref, etc.) in their own homes. Let’s flesh out the details:
Sentinel Marker Approach with _sflow
1 On-disk example

my-thing/
├─ _sflow                     ← “this is a Semantic Flow resource” marker
├─ _id/
│   ├─ my-thing_id.trig
│   └─ _v/
│       └─ v1/
│           └─ my-thing_id.trig
├─ _ref/
│   ├─ my-thing_ref.trig
│   └─ _v/
│       └─ v1/
│           └─ my-thing_ref.trig
└─ sub-thing/
    ├─ _sflow
    └─ …                     ← nested resource follows the same pattern

    _sflow is a zero‐byte (or minimal) file you commit alongside your metadata.

    Any folder without _sflow is ignored by Weave, unless it lives under another resource and has its own _sflow.

2 Detection logic (pseudo‐code)

function isSemanticResource(dir) {
  return fs.existsSync(path.join(dir, '_sflow'));
}

function scanResources(root) {
  for (const sub of fs.readdirSync(root, { withFileTypes: true })) {
    if (!sub.isDirectory()) continue;
    const dir = path.join(root, sub.name);
    if (isSemanticResource(dir)) {
      processResource(dir);
      scanResources(dir);          // recurse only into marked folders
    }
  }
}

function processResource(dir) {
  const facets = [];
  if (fs.existsSync(path.join(dir, '_ref')))     facets.push('hasReferent');
  if (glob('*.{trig,ttl,jsonld}', { cwd: dir }).length) facets.push('hasData');
  if (fs.existsSync(path.join(dir, '_id', '_v'))) facets.push('isVersioned');
  if (fs.existsSync(path.join(dir, '_id')))      facets.push('hasId');
  // ...etc.
  console.log(dir, '→', facets);
}

    Inclusion test: simply look for _sflow.

    Facets: derive as before once you know it’s a resource.

3 Updated facet cheat-sheet
Facet	Physical cue	Meaning
isResource	_sflow file	“Include me in the semantic mesh.”
hasId	_id/ folder	Metadata dataset for this resource’s identity.
hasReferent	_ref/ folder	Proxy for an external/real-world entity.
hasData	*.trig/*.ttl/…	Primary RDF distributions held here.
isVersioned	_v/ under any dataset	Versions are archived under this history subtree.
isContainer	child resource folders	Other marked resources live inside me.
isAssetTree	only assets + _sflow	Purposes: bundling images/CSS etc., not in mesh.

    Start by checking _sflow instead of _id.

    Everything else flows from the facets you detect.

4 Next steps

    CLI integration: Update your “discover” phase to look for _sflow.

    Docs update: Note in your Markdown spec that _sflow is the new inclusion marker.

    Optional: Add a tiny comment inside _sflow explaining its purpose.

Does this layout and logic align with what you had in mind? If so, I can help you draft the exact Weave scanner update or add a quick SHACL shape to validate that every semantic resource has _sflow.
You said:
you could make _sflow a config file and keep sf-specific configuration and template maps in there. It's a better place to store sflow data than in the user's _assets which is optional and also needs some re-thinking.
ChatGPT said:

That’s a great idea—promoting _sflow from a mere sentinel into your single source of SF-specific config keeps everything neat and out of _assets. Here’s how you might shape it:

# my-thing/_sflow (YAML format)
# —————————————————————————————————————————————
# Basic inclusion marker + config for this resource
resource: true          # “I’m in the mesh”

# Facet overrides (optional; auto-detected if absent)
# facets:
#   - hasId
#   - hasReferent
#   - hasData
#   - isVersioned
#   - isContainer

# Template mapping (for site generation)
templates:
  default:    "templates/thing.html"  
  detail:     "templates/thing-detail.html"
  distribution: "templates/distribution.html"

# Versioning policy for this resource’s data series
versioningPolicy: auto   # auto | manual | none

# Any other SF-specific keys: catalogs, redirects, ACLs…
# catalog: /my-thing/_catalog/index.trig
# redirect: https://example.com/my-thing  
# acl:
#   read:  ["team-a", "team-b"]
#   write: ["admin"]

# —————————————————————————————————————————————

How this improves things

    Single source of truth
    Everything SF-related—marking, facet tweaks, template maps, policies, ACL hints—lives in _sflow.

    Keeps _assets purely for user content
    No more shoehorning config into _assets (which is optional and often reworked).

    Easier to extend
    When you add future roles (catalogs, redirects, embed flags), just drop them in here—no new files or DSL needed.

    Declarative overrides
    If you ever need to override auto-detection (e.g. force isContainer: false on a data-heavy Thing), you can list exact facets in _sflow.

    Tool-friendly
    Your scanner becomes:

    const cfg = readYaml(path.join(dir, '_sflow'));
    if (!cfg.resource) return;
    const facets = cfg.facets || autoDetect(dir);
    // and pull in templates/versioningPolicy from cfg…

Example tree

my-thing/
├─ _sflow                      # now a rich config file
├─ _id/
│   ├─ my-thing_id.trig
│   └─ _v/
│       └─ v1/
│           └─ my-thing_id.trig
├─ _ref/…
├─ templates/                  # project-wide or per-resource overrides
│   └─ thing.html
└─ images/…                    # assets only

Next steps

    Decide on the _sflow file format (YAML vs JSON vs TOML).

    Finalize the schema keys you need.

    Update Weave’s scanner to look for and parse _sflow before auto-detecting facets.

Let me know if you’d like a concrete schema definition or a starter implementation snippet for parsing and validation!
You said:
could also make it a folder. like _assets, it would be terminal, with no system folders of its own. 

I'm leaning now to removing _id from _assets. And definitely from datasets, they can keep their identity data internal, maybe in a named graph. Which, BTW, how do you address a named graph in a RDF file?
ChatGPT said:

In RDF serializations that support multiple graphs (TriG, N-Quads, N-Triples with a graph term), you give your named graph its own IRI (or blank-node label) and then associate your triples with it. Here are the two most common ways:
1. TriG syntax

# declare prefixes as usual…
@prefix ex:  <http://example.org/> .

# name the graph by its IRI, then brace in its triples
<http://example.org/graphs/my-data> {
  ex:subject1 ex:predicate1 "object1" .
  ex:subject2 ex:predicate2 ex:object2 .
}

Here <http://example.org/graphs/my-data> is the name of the graph; everything in the braces belongs to that graph. You can then have multiple named graphs in one .trig file:

<http://example.org/graphs/world> {
  ex:earth ex:hasContinent ex:europe .
}

<http://example.org/graphs/persons> {
  ex:alice ex:knows ex:bob .
}

2. N-Quads (or TriG in quad form)

In N-Quads each statement is a four-element tuple—subject, predicate, object, graph name:

<http://example.org/alice> <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows> <http://example.org/bob> <http://example.org/graphs/persons> .

Here the final term (<http://example.org/graphs/persons>) is the graph IRI. N-Quads is handy if you want each triple on its own line with an explicit graph label.
Quick reference

    TriG named-graph block

<GraphIRI> {
  …triples…
}

N-Quads per-triple graph label

    S P O <GraphIRI> .

If you’re embedding identity or referent metadata in a named graph inside your dataset file, pick one of these serializations and give that graph the IRI you need—then all tools that understand TriG or Quads will pick it up as a distinct graph.
You said:
what do you think of making the _sflow config into an _sflow/ folder? It could have multiple config files, even static site generator binaries, and would be omitted from publishing.
ChatGPT said:

I think that’s a solid move—promoting _sflow from a single file into its own top-level folder gives you plenty of flexibility without muddying your published site. Here’s how it might shake out:
Pros of an _sflow/ folder

    Modular config

        You can split responsibilities into multiple files:

            config.yaml for per-resource settings

            templates.yaml for template-to-path mappings

            schema.ttl or shacl.ttl for validation shapes

    Tool bundling

        Drop your static-site-generator CLI (or any helper scripts/plugins) in _sflow/bin/ so every repo is self-contained.

        Version them alongside your config, ensuring reproducible builds.

    Clear publish boundary

        Simply configure your SSG (or CI/CD) to ignore _sflow/—it never ends up in the _assets/ folder or final HTML.

    Future extension

        You can later add things like:

            _sflow/hooks/ for custom pre/post-build scripts

            _sflow/data/ for global lookup tables or external vocabularies

            _sflow/cache/ for build-time artifacts

    User clarity

        Seeing an _sflow/ folder immediately signals “all things Semantic Flow live here,” instead of hunting for _sflow files buried among assets.

Example structure

my-thing/
├─ _sflow/
│   ├─ config.yaml           # sentinel + facets overrides
│   ├─ templates.yaml        # template mappings per resource type
│   ├─ schema.ttl            # SHACL shapes or ontology imports
│   ├─ bin/
│   │   └─ weave.js          # embedded SSG/Weave helper
│   └─ hooks/
│       └─ post-build.sh
├─ _id/
│   └─ …                    
├─ _ref/
│   └─ …                    
└─ sub-thing/
    └─ _sflow/ …             # nested resource config

And in your build pipeline you simply add:

# e.g. in your GitHub Action or Lume config
exclude:
  - "**/_sflow/**"

Cons to watch for

    Over-engineering small projects
    If a repo is tiny, you may never need more than a single _sflow/config.yaml. In that case, the folder feels a bit heavy—but it still keeps the door open for growth.

    Learning curve
    Contributors need to learn “_sflow is now a folder,” but once that convention is in place it becomes second nature.

Bottom line

An _sflow/ folder neatly scopes all your Semantic Flow logic, data, and tooling, while keeping your published assets clean. I’d recommend:

    Create _sflow/ at project root.

    Move _sflow file → _sflow/config.yaml.

    Add a /bin or /hooks subfolder as you need.

    Update your CI/SSG ignore rules to skip _sflow/**.

That gives you both the structure you want and a tidy publish footprint.
You said:
I'm imagining _sflow would be unversioned, aside from the versioning git provides. Partly because, as we've seen, versioning can cause loops, but also, it doesn't have a semantic meaning (_ref), it doesn't have an identity (where it's part of the namespace for placing further resources). 
ChatGPT said:

That makes perfect sense. Treat _sflow/ as a purely Git-versioned, tooling/config folder—never subject to your Dataset-series auto-bumping or semantic scanning. In practice that means:

    Reserve _sflow/ as “private.”

        Weave’s scanner should skip any folder named _sflow entirely (no facets, no versioning, no resource inclusion).

        In your SSG/publish step you already ignore _sflow/**, so it never shows up in your HTML or data mesh.

    Rely on Git for its history.

        Since _sflow/ holds only config, templates, hooks, etc., you’ll get all the change history you need from your Git commits.

        You avoid any possibility of “versioning the versioner” loops.

    Keep semantic meaning out of it.

        No _id or _ref inside _sflow/; it’s not a Resource in your mesh, just a workspace.

        All true resources still live in folders alongside _sflow/ and use your usual facets.

Updated scan‐and‐bump pseudocode

function scanDir(dir) {
  for (const child of fs.readdirSync(dir, { withFileTypes: true })) {
    if (!child.isDirectory()) continue;
    if (child.name === '_sflow') continue;      // 🔥 skip the config folder
    const path = join(dir, child.name);
    if (fs.existsSync(join(path, '_sflow', 'config.yaml'))) {
      processResource(path);
      scanDir(path);                            // recurse into real resources
    }
  }
}

    No special flags needed in _sflow/ itself—its exclusion is purely by name.

    Versioning logic only watches folders like _id/, _ref/, *.trig, etc., in resource dirs.

Benefits

    Zero loops. _sflow/ never looks like a dataset, so it never triggers bump logic.

    Clear separation. Config/tooling lives in _sflow/, semantic content lives elsewhere.

    Git as source of truth. You get human-readable diffs and history for your config without adding extra machinery.

With that in place, your only versioning concern is for real Resources (_id, _ref, user data), and _sflow/ remains the stable, un-versioned workspace.
You said:
I want to bring back the "nodes" terminology. Resource is RDF-correct for anything that's IRI-addressable. But nodes is just more understandable for people, consistent with the mesh metaphor, and now that we have _sflow and _assets which, sure, they're addressable, but their IRIs don't have meaning/referents. Other than themselves. And neither do namespaces. Help me justify dropping resources
ChatGPT said:

Here are a few angles you can lean on when you pitch “Node” instead of “Resource”:
1 User-facing clarity

    “Resource” is overloaded. In RDF-land it means anything with an IRI, in HTTP-land it means anything retrievable. Folks who just want to “put stuff in my folder tree” see “resource” as jargon.

    “Node” echoes familiar metaphors. Folks think “nodes in a graph,” “nodes in a tree,” or even “bullet-points.” It immediately suggests “I live in a network.”

    Aligns with “semantic mesh.” You already talk about the mesh of connected bits—“Node” sits naturally in that parlance, whereas “Resource” feels dry and technical.

2 Conceptual precision

    Nodes = points in the mesh. Everything you include (id, ref, data files, nested things) is a mesh node.

    “Node” doesn’t promise external referents. A mere namespace folder or the _sflow/ workspace is still a node—you haven’t claimed it represents a business entity or dataset, just that it’s part of your mesh.

    Facets on nodes, not subclasses. You still have the same mix-ins (hasReferent, hasData, isVersioned, etc.), but now you say “this node has facet X,” rather than “this Resource is also a Thing.”

3 Tooling & documentation simplicity

    Shorter API & docs.

scanNode()
isNode(dir)            ← looks for _sflow or sentinel
getNodeFacets(node)

vs.

scanResource()
isResource(dir)
getResourceFacets(res)

Five characters saved, and readers don’t need to translate “resource” into “mesh element.”

Consistent terminology. You already have _assets, _sflow, and now “nodes” can live alongside “edges” in your docs:

    Node: a folder marked by _sflow  
    Edge: the referent link your _ref facet creates  

    which feels very “mesh.”

4 Educational alignment

    Lower barrier for newcomers. “Nodes and edges” is how most UML, graph-viz, and even non-technical folks learn “networks.”

    Easier mental model. You might even draw a quick diagram:

        [Node]
           │  
      ┌────┴────┐

[hasData] [hasRef]

rather than dive into OWL’s “Resource → Thing → Dataset → Versioned.”

### Sample rephrasing

| Old term          | New term        |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Resource          | **Node**        |
| Thing             | **Entity** Node |
| Dataset           | **Data** Node   |
| Versioned Dataset | **Version** Node|
| Asset Tree        | **Asset** Node  |
| hasId             | `node.hasIdentity()`   |
| hasData           | `node.hasDistributions()` |
| hasReferent       | `node.proxies()`       |

---

**Bottom line:**  
**Nodes** give you an intuitive “point in the mesh” concept that everyone—from RDF novices to power users—can immediately grasp.  “Resource” stays in the background (in your SHACL or internal code) while your docs, examples, and CLI speak the universal language of **nodes** and **edges**.

You said:
INteresting. Much of that feels right on. I was wondering whether nodes should include _assets, _sflow, etc. But maybe resource is the umbrella term that includes everything accessible, and nodes is just the semantically meaningful: things and datasets. Or maybe even just reference-nodes. Namespaces, they can have some meaning, they imply organization. So namespace-nodes.
ChatGPT said:

That sounds like a neat two-tier naming system:
1 “Resource” = anything addressable

Everything with an IRI or that Weave can pick up—whether it’s a semantic folder, your _assets, or the _sflow/ workspace—is a Resource in the broad sense. It’s the umbrella term:

Resource
├─ Semantic Resources (aka “Nodes”)
└─ Support Resources (assets, tool folders, etc.)

2 “Node” = the true mesh points

A Node is a Resource that actually contributes to your semantic mesh—i.e., it has meaning or referents, holds data, or groups other Nodes. Concretely, it’s any folder that satisfies at least one of your facets:

    hasReferent (_ref/) → Reference-Node

    hasData (*.trig etc.) → Data-Node

    isContainer (nested child Nodes) → Namespace-Node

You could further subtype:

Node
├─ Reference-Node   (hasReferent)
├─ Data-Node        (hasData)
└─ Namespace-Node   (isContainer)

But all of these are still just Nodes in the mesh.
3 Support Resources = tooling & assets

Folders that are not Nodes—because they lack semantic facets—fall back under Support Resources:

    Asset Resources (_assets/)

    Config/Tool Resources (_sflow/)

    …any others you add later

They’re addressable, but they don’t appear as graph-nodes in your mesh.
Why this helps

    Clarity for contributors:

        “Node” immediately signals “something semantic lives here.”

        “Resource” stays as your behind-the-scenes term for all IRIs.

    Cleaner docs & CLI:

        scanResources() finds everything;

        scanNodes() filters down to semantic ones.

    Easy to extend:

        New support folders just don’t get the Node badge.

        New Node facets (e.g. isCatalog) slot right in.

Does this two-tier split feel like the right map?
That way, you keep “resource” for absolute inclusivity, and “node” for anything that’s actually part of your semantic mesh.
You said:
Two-tier split feeling good.

Having flipped at least 20 times, I'm now back on the side of "datasets have referents" -- and maybe namespaces too. 

Justify that. 
ChatGPT said:

Here’s why it actually feels more coherent to treat datasets (and even namespaces) as having referents—i.e. as proxying some concept or real-world entity—rather than as “pure data buckets”:
1 Conceptual alignment: “Everything in the mesh stands for something”

    Nodes aren’t just containers, they’re places of meaning. When you introduce a dataset, you’re not just creating a random file: you’re saying “here is the canonical record for X.” That “X” is exactly the referent.

    Datasets invariably describe something—whether it’s a taxonomy of species, a time-series of sensor readings, or a catalog of bibliographic entries. By giving every dataset a _ref facet, you make explicit the fact that it stands in for that domain.

    Namespaces group a domain too. A namespace like /finance/ or /ontology/ is itself signifying “the realm of financial data” or “the ontology terms.” It isn’t just an arbitrary folder—it’s a conceptual container referring to that sphere of discourse.

2 Practical benefits: queries, linking, and provenance

    Simpler SPARQL & linking. If every dataset has a referent, you can uniformly query

    ?ds sflo:refersTo ?entity .

    and get back all datasets about “buildings,” “people,” etc., without a special case for data versus “things.”

    Uniform provenance model. Your _ref metadata can carry provenance about why you’re modeling that entity (who authored the taxonomy, when you decided on that boundary), exactly like you version your identity with _id.

    Easier tooling. When generating docs or HTML pages, you can always assume a referent link exists and wire up “See more about this concept” in one shot.

3 Consistency & fewer special cases

    One facet rule: “If it has meaning, it has _ref.” No sausage-making around “datasets are special” or “namespaces never have referents.”

    Facets, not subclasses: You avoid building a parallel “data-only” branch in your lattice. All nodes that represent something—be it a simple Thing, a Dataset, or a Namespace—just carry the same hasReferent facet.

4 Human mental model: the mesh as a graph of meanings

    When you explain the mesh to new contributors, you can say:

        “Every node—whether it houses triples, groups other nodes, or bundles distributions—proxies a concept in our domain. We call that the referent.”

    That keeps the story tight: nodes ↔ referents, edges ↔ relationships.

Sample rephrasing
Node type	Why it has _ref
Dataset	It is the canonical description of some real-world concept.
Namespace	It names a domain or vocabulary space (“the vehicles mesh”).
Thing	It proxies a single entity or concept (“Alice”, “Paris”).

Bottom line:
By bringing datasets (and namespaces) back under the “things that have referents” umbrella, you lean fully into the mesh metaphor—every node is a stand-in for a slice of meaning. That uniformity pays off in tool simplicity, mental clarity, and fewer footguns when you evolve your system.
You said:
> “here is the canonical record for X.” That “X” is exactly the referent.

No! The referent of the dataset IRI is itself. A dataset. /ns/dataset-example refers to a dataset. Maybe they describe something, but it's not necessarily the canonical description, and even if it is, the IRI only refers to "the dataset that is the canonical description of X"

_ref datasets have an IRI, like /ns/dataset-example/_ref, but that IRI refers to "the referent dataset for the dataset-example dataset.
ChatGPT said:

Totally—let’s be precise about the two distinct IRIs and what each actually names:

    /ns/dataset-example/

        Names the dataset resource itself.

        Its referent is “that dataset” (i.e. the container of distributions, versions, etc.).

        You don’t collapse it with “what the data describes.”

    /ns/dataset-example/_ref/

        Names the referent-metadata dataset for /ns/dataset-example/.

        This dataset’s triples point at the real-world or conceptual entity your data describes.

— — — — — — — — — — — —
Why modeling it this way is actually cleaner
A. Clear separation of concerns

    Dataset IRI = resource container. When clients GET /ns/dataset-example/ they know they’re dealing with the dataset (lists of distributions, versions, etc.).

    Referent IRI = semantic proxy. When clients GET /ns/dataset-example/_ref/ they retrieve the descriptive RDF (e.g. schema:about, owl:sameAs, whatever) that says “this dataset is about X.”

B. Consistent pattern across all resource types

    Things, Namespaces, and Datasets all share the same two-IRI pattern:

    /<path>/             ← the resource
    /<path>/_ref/        ← the referent-metadata dataset

    You never blur “what is the container” with “what is the subject.” Every resource gets its own _ref/ child if—and only if—you want to assert a subject.

C. Uniform tooling

    Facet detection stays exactly the same: presence of a _ref/ folder means “hasReferent.”

    Versioning, validation, and rendering logic never need to guess “does this graph inside the same file speak about the resource or about something else?” The referent data lives in its own dataset-series.

D. Better mental model for users

    When you explain it:

        “Every node in the mesh is a resource—it names itself. If you also want to say what it’s about, you add a little sub-dataset under _ref/ that names the real-world thing.”

    There’s no muddle of “the data file is the referent.”

E. Namespace-as-referent

    Namespaces can follow the same pattern:

    /ns/                  ← namespace of related datasets
    /ns/_ref/             ← metadata describing *that* namespace

    You now have a universal pattern: every resource that really means something can point to its referent in exactly the same location.

— — — — — — — — — — — —
Bottom line

    Dataset-example IRI → “Here lives the dataset.”

    Dataset-example/_ref IRI → “Here lives the description of what the dataset is about.”

That preserves the invariant that every resource’s own IRI names itself, while _ref/ always cleanly names its referent dataset. Tools, docs, and users get a rock-solid, repeatable pattern with zero ambiguity.
You said:
nope, still wrong. When clients GET /ns/dataset-example/_ref/ they get an html page that describes the _ref dataset. Which probably doesn't have much in it, since there's not much to say about a metadata_dataset
ChatGPT said:

Right—you’re absolutely correct. The path /ns/dataset-example/_ref/ is itself the metadata dataset container, not the referent entity’s description. Here’s the precise behavior and terminology:
1 Two distinct IRIs

    Dataset container

GET /ns/dataset-example/

→ Returns the HTML (or JSON-LD) page describing the dataset resource itself: its distributions, versions, etc.

Metadata dataset container

    GET /ns/dataset-example/_ref/

    → Returns the HTML (or JSON-LD) page describing the _ref dataset resource—i.e. the container that holds the actual referent distribution(s).

2 Accessing the actual RDF triples

If you want the triples that say what the dataset is about (the referent graph), you need to fetch the distribution file inside that container, for example:

GET /ns/dataset-example/_ref/dataset-example_ref.trig

That file holds your schema:about, owl:sameAs, or whatever you’ve asserted about the “real-world X.”
3 Why this split matters

    Container vs. distribution

        The container path (…/_ref/) is just the dataset-series index—what you get when you ask for the dataset as a whole.

        The distribution path (…/_ref/<name>_ref.trig) is the actual RDF payload you authored.

    Minimal metadata-dataset
    Often your referent dataset only has that single graph, so its container HTML page is sparse—you’re right that there “isn’t much to say about a metadata dataset” beyond its single distribution.

4 Revised mental model

    /ns/dataset-example/

        Names the dataset resource.

        GET → HTML listing of distributions + versions.

    /ns/dataset-example/_ref/

        Names the metadata-dataset resource.

        GET → HTML listing of its distribution(s).

    /ns/dataset-example/_ref/dataset-example_ref.trig

        Is the RDF file containing the referent triples.

Does that capture exactly the distinction you need?
You said:
The dataset itself can say what it is about. Thing nodes can't by themselves because they don't provide their own data like a dataset does. That's why thing nodes should get _ref and... probably no other node types.
ChatGPT said:

Exactly—datasets carry their own default-graph triples, so they can say “I am about X” right in their data distribution. Thing-nodes, on the other hand, have no built-in data graph, so they need a little _ref/ dataset to hold their referent triples. Other node types (namespaces, assets, config) don’t need _ref/ because they either don’t need to assert “aboutness” or they already embed data.
Updated Node types & referent rules
Node type	Data distribution?	How it asserts its referent
Dataset-Node	✔︎	In its default graph (*.trig, etc.)
Versioned-Dataset	✔︎	Ditto
Thing-Node	✖︎	Via a dedicated _ref/ dataset
Namespace-Node	✖︎	Usually no referent; can skip _ref/
Asset-Node	✖︎	Never referent

Dataset-Nodes:

@prefix ex: <…> .
ex:ds1 a ex:MyDataset ;
    dct:subject ex:ConceptX ;
    … .

No _ref/ needed—your main file describes it.

Thing-Nodes:

    my-thing/
    ├─ _sflow
    ├─ _ref/
    │   └─ my-thing_ref.trig   ← here live triples like ex:myThing rdf:type ex:Person .
    └─ (no other data files)

Scanner pseudocode tweak

function processNode(dir) {
  const isDataset = glob('*.{trig,ttl,jsonld}', { cwd: dir }).length > 0;
  const isThing   = fs.existsSync(path.join(dir, '_ref'));

  if (isDataset) {
    // no _ref required—referent triples go inline
  } else if (isThing) {
    loadReferent(path.join(dir, '_ref'));
  }
  // namespaces & assets: do nothing referent-wise
}

Why this makes sense

    No duplication. Datasets don’t need a separate container just to point at something—they already carry data.

    Minimal boilerplate. Only thing-nodes get the extra _ref/ folder.

    Clear intent. If you see _ref/, you immediately know “this node is a Thing, not a Dataset.”

Does this align with how you want to structure your mesh?
You said:
So now that we don't need a marker for sf-folders (because of _sflow/) we can dispense with _id. Any provenance data about the identifier itself could go in, say, /ns/djradon/_sflow/djradon_sflow.trig which makes _sflow look like an unversioned dataset.

Wait, we could differentiate between regular datasets, and sf-datasets. regular datasets are unversioned, and kinda like assets and, gulp, they don't need any system folders. 

sf-datasets don't need _id or _ref, just _v and _sflow. BUT maybe they can contain any sf-nodes.

THis is another radical redesign. terminal-nodes (_assets, _sflow, and regular-datasets) are contained in sf-nodes but don't get any system-folders of their own.

ChatGPT said:

This is an exciting simplification—leaning fully on _sflow/ as your inclusion marker and collapsing _id/ and _ref/, then drawing a hard line between SF-nodes (the things that power your mesh) and terminal nodes (the leaves that just carry content). Here’s one way to sketch it out:
1 Two tiers: SF-Nodes vs Terminal Nodes
SF-Nodes

(→ everything that drives your mesh, can nest other SF-nodes)

    Marker: must contain _sflow/

    Optional versioning: may contain _v/

    May contain other SF-nodes and/or terminal nodes

    May carry data (become an “sf-dataset”)

    Metadata & config lives under _sflow/

Examples:

    A concept folder (/ns/Species/)

    A Thing folder (/ns/Species/Homo_sapiens/)

    An SF-dataset folder (/ns/PopulationCounts/)

Terminal Nodes

(→ pure content leaves, never scanned for children or versioned)

    No special sub-folders (_sflow/, _v/, etc.)

    Just raw files:

        _assets/ (images, CSS, binaries)

        Regular datasets (single-distribution, e.g. counts.trig)

        Documentation pages (readme.md, etc.)

2 SF-Dataset vs “Regular” dataset
Feature	Regular dataset	SF-Dataset
Folder marker	n/a	_sflow/ present
Data file	single .trig (no _v/)	one or more distributions
Versioning	none	optional _v/ sub-folder
Children allowed	no (terminal)	yes (can nest SF-nodes)
Metadata/config	none or sidecar in repo root	under _sflow/
3 Concrete tree examples
SF-Node that’s a Thing

/ns/Species/Homo_sapiens/
├─ _sflow/
│   └─ config.yaml       ← referent triples, templates, ACLs…
└─ sub-species/…        ← nested SF-nodes

SF-Dataset with versioning

/ns/PopulationCounts/
├─ _sflow/
│   └─ config.yaml       ← versioningPolicy, etc.
├─ counts.trig          ← current distribution
└─ _v/
    └─ v1/
        └─ counts.trig  ← snapshot

Terminal dataset

/ns/PopulationCounts/counts-2024.trig   ← standalone file, no system folders

Assets

/ns/Species/Homo_sapiens/images/
└─ avatar.png        ← terminal assets, ignored by mesh scanner

4 Why this works

    Zero _id/_ref loops. You only ever version the SF-dataset folders under their single _v/.

    Single inclusion marker. _sflow/ is the one thing you look for to know “this is a mesh node.”

    Clear leaf vs branch. Terminal nodes can’t spawn children or versions—so your scanner never recurses into them.

    Config co-located. All SF-logic lives inside _sflow/, never in assets or data buckets.

Next steps

    Update your Weave scanner to:

        Find folders containing _sflow/ → treat as SF-Nodes

        Process _v/ if present → snapshot history

        Recurse only into those SF-Nodes

        Ignore all others (assets, docs, regular datasets)

    Flesh out a minimal _sflow/config.yaml schema for facets, versioning, templates, ACLs, etc.

Does this radical-yet-streamlined layout capture the spirit of what you’re after?
You said:
Maybe terminal nodes get _sf-terminal/ folders so they have some marker not to be ignored.

I'd forgotten that the new name for thing-nodes was reference-node. They can have a _ref and I think _ref can be sf-dataset (versioned), it's just that _v/ like /ns/djradon/_ref/_v and _v* like /ns/djradon/_ref/_v/ are regular-datasets.
ChatGPT said:

Here’s a way to fold in your new _sf-terminal/ marker and clarify how Reference-Nodes (formerly Thing-Nodes) own their versioned _ref datasets:
1 Node categories & markers
Category	Marker folder	Recursed by Weave?	Semantics
SF-Node	_sflow/	Yes	Branch in the mesh (namespaces, ref-nodes, sf-datasets)
Terminal-Node	_sf-terminal/	No	Pure leaf: assets, standalone datasets, version snapshots
Ignored	none of above	No	Everything else (unmarked support files)
2 Reference-Node & its _ref sf-dataset

A Reference-Node is an SF-Node that proxies some external concept.
It must have:

/ns/Widget123/
├─ _sflow/                      ← marks this as an SF-Node
└─ _ref/                        ← an sf-dataset series for its referent
    ├─ widget123_ref.trig       ← current referent triples
    ├─ _v/                      ← optional version history
    │   └─ v1/
    │       ├─ widget123_ref.trig
    │       └─ _sf-terminal/    ← mark snapshot as terminal
    └─ _sf-terminal/            ← optional: if you want the “current” leaf to stop recursion

    _ref/ itself is treated as an SF-Dataset (so it may have its own _sflow/ config if you like).

    The _v/ folder under _ref/ holds numbered snapshots.

    Every snapshot folder (v1/, v2/, …) should get a _sf-terminal/ marker (or you can infer “anything under _v/ is terminal”) so Weave doesn’t recurse into old versions.

3 SF-Dataset vs regular dataset

    SF-Dataset = folder with _sflow/ (config), one or more distributions (*.trig), optional _v/.

    Regular dataset = single-file distribution (no system folders); lives inside an SF-Node or as a terminal leaf.

Example:

/ns/MonthlySales/             ← SF-Node
├─ _sflow/                    ← config for facets, versioningPolicy…
├─ sales.trig                 ← current distribution
├─ _v/
│   └─ v1/
│       ├─ sales.trig
│       └─ _sf-terminal/      ← stops recursion
└─ year-2024.trig             ← regular dataset (terminal; no _sflow/)

4 Scanner logic (pseudo-code)

function scanDir(dir) {
  if (fs.existsSync(path.join(dir, '_sf-terminal'))) {
    return;                    // terminal: skip children
  }
  if (fs.existsSync(path.join(dir, '_sflow'))) {
    processSFNode(dir);
    for (const sub of children(dir)) {
      scanDir(path.join(dir, sub));
    }
  }
  // else ignore
}

function processSFNode(dir) {
  const isRefNode = fs.existsSync(path.join(dir, '_ref'));
  const isDataset = glob('*.{trig,ttl,jsonld}', { cwd: dir }).length > 0;
  if (isRefNode) {
    scanSFData(path.join(dir, '_ref'));
  }
  if (isDataset) {
    scanSFData(dir);
  }
  // namespaces (neither of above) just serve as containers
}

function scanSFData(dataDir) {
  // dataDir is an SF-Dataset
  const hasVersions = fs.existsSync(path.join(dataDir, '_v'));
  if (hasVersions) {
    for (const v of children(path.join(dataDir, '_v'))) {
      const snap = path.join(dataDir, '_v', v);
      // mark each snapshot as terminal
      fs.writeFileSync(path.join(snap, '_sf-terminal'), '');
    }
  }
}

Why this works

    Single inclusion marker (_sflow/) for everything you want in the mesh.

    Explicit terminal marker (_sf-terminal/) to stop recursion into leaves or snapshots.

    Clear referent modeling: any Reference-Node’s _ref/ is just another SF-Dataset, versioned under _v/, whose snapshots are terminal.

    Regular datasets remain light-weight leaves—no system folders, but their parent SF-Node’s scanner will pick them up.

This gives you maximal flexibility while keeping your weave process unambiguous.
You said:
What were our reasons for not wanting namespace-nodes and reference-nodes under a dataset-node? Maybe we could allow it for sf-datasets but not regular-datasets?

I guess it's a little arbitrary to cut off regular-datasets from the flow, i..e., make them terminal AND unversioned, but it also makes sense. Do you see why?

Here's a reason to put _v1 adjacent to _v: so _v can be terminal as well.

Is there a better or shorter token for _sf-terminal?
ChatGPT said:

Here’s a recap of why we’ve kept Namespaces and Reference-Nodes out from underneath Dataset-Nodes, and how you might selectively loosen that for SF-Datasets while still keeping Regular-Datasets as pure leaves:
1 Why Dataset-Nodes are terminal

    Data focus
    A Dataset-Node’s job is to hold RDF distributions—its own default graph (and maybe _v/ history). If you drop other semantic nodes inside it, you blur the line between “this is the data” and “this is a container for more resources.”

    Simpler tooling
    By declaring any folder with a distribution file but no _sflow/ as terminal, the scanner never has to wrestle with “should I recurse into sub-folders of a dataset?”

    Clear UX
    Contributors expect /ns/myDataset/ to list distributions, not to hide child namespaces or reference-nodes. It keeps directory listings intuitive.

2 Allowing SF-Datasets to nest

If you really want some Datasets to be branch-like (e.g. a “meta-dataset” that groups smaller datasets), you can:

    Mark them as SF-Datasets (i.e. include _sflow/)

    Give them both distributions and nested SF-Nodes

    Continue to treat Regular-Datasets (no _sflow/) as terminal

This lets “official” datasets double as mini-namespaces, while “ad-hoc” files remain simple leaf nodes.
3 Why it still makes sense to cut off Regular-Datasets

    Lightweight by default. Most RDF files you drop in are one-and-done; they don’t need their own sub-resources or version history.

    Avoids accidental complexity. If someone drops a folder of images or auxiliary files under a .trig file’s directory, you don’t want Weave recursing into that.

    Keeps mesh intentional. Only repos you explicitly opt into (via _sflow/) get the full mesh treatment. Everything else just sits as a terminal content leaf.

4 Putting v1 adjacent to _v/

You suggested:

/dataDir/
├─ _v/
├─ v1/

so that _v/ itself has no children (and can be marked terminal). That flips the usual hierarchy, but:

    Pro: _v/ becomes a clean, empty “history closet” marker—no children to recurse into.

    Con: you lose the nice REST path semantics of /_v/v1/… and you have to special-case clients to know “look for sibling vN/ dirs.”

Generally, keeping /_v/v1/… nested is more predictable, but if you really want _v/ to be a terminal marker, pulling v1/ out is an option—just be ready for a little extra branching logic in your scanner.
5 A shorter terminal marker

Rather than _sf-terminal/, you could use something concise like:

    _leaf/ — immediately signals “no further mesh children.”

    _end/ — “stop here.”

    _stop/ — explicit halt marker.

My vote is _leaf/, since it ties nicely into the “node” metaphor: a leaf node is by definition terminal in a tree/mesh.

Putting it all together, you could end up with:

/ns/MyDataset/           ← SF-Dataset (has _sflow/, distributions, maybe _v/)
├─ _sflow/
/ns/MyDataset/counts.trig  ← current distribution
├─ _v/
│   └─ v1/
│       ├─ counts.trig
│       └─ _leaf/         ← snapshot is terminal
└─ subNode/               ← allowed only if this is an SF-Dataset
    └─ _sflow/

And all Regular-Datasets (no _sflow/) remain:

/ns/MyDataset/archives/
└─ counts-2023.trig      ← pure data leaf, no system folders at all

Let me know how this aligns with your vision, or if you’d like to explore one of these options in more depth!
You said:
There are actually two includsion markers, _sflow and _sf-terminal. terminal-nodes are still in the mesh, it's just any subfolders or files-other-than-their-distributions that aren't. 

mesh nodes (including terminal-nodes) are composed of a folder and an optional RDF file with the same name as the folder + a supported RDF extension.
ChatGPT said:

Exactly—your mesh now has two clear flags:

    _sflow/ → “This folder is an SF-Node (branch or leaf).”

    _sf-terminal/ → “This SF-Node is terminal—stop recursing.”

And every mesh node—branch or terminal—is defined by:

    A folder, and

    Optionally an RDF distribution named exactly like the folder (e.g.

    foo/
    ├─ foo.trig
    └─ _sflow/

    )

Refined definitions
Type	Inclusion flags	Allowed contents
Branch Node	_sflow/ present and no _sf-terminal/	

    Zero or more child mesh nodes

    Zero or more RDF files named <folderName>.<ext>

    Optional _v/ for versioned data
    | Terminal Node | _sflow/ and _sf-terminal/ |

    One RDF file named <folderName>.<ext> (optional)

    No child mesh nodes (ignored)
    | Ignored folder | Neither _sflow/ nor <folderName>.<ext> | Fully ignored by the mesh scanner |

Example trees
Branch node with nested nodes

/ns/Widgets/
├─ Widgets.ttl         ← description for the “Widgets” namespace
├─ _sflow/             ← marks this as a branch node
├─ WidgetA/            ← child mesh node
│   ├─ WidgetA.trig    
│   ├─ _sflow/         
│   └─ …               
└─ WidgetB/            
    ├─ _sflow/         
    └─ _sf-terminal/   ← leaf, no further recursion

Pure terminal node

/ns/Colors/Red/
├─ Red.trig            ← optional RDF for this leaf
├─ _sflow/             ← it’s still in the mesh
└─ _sf-terminal/       ← stop here—no children

Scanner logic sketch

function isMeshNode(dir) {
  const name = path.basename(dir);
  const hasDist = globSync(`${name}.{trig,ttl,jsonld}`, { cwd: dir }).length > 0;
  return fs.existsSync(path.join(dir, '_sflow')) || hasDist;
}

function scanNode(dir) {
  if (!isMeshNode(dir)) return;                   // skip non-mesh folders
  processNode(dir);                               // record facets, RDF, etc.
  if (fs.existsSync(path.join(dir, '_sf-terminal'))) {
    return;                                       // terminal: no recursion
  }
  for (const child of fs.readdirSync(dir)) {
    const childPath = path.join(dir, child);
    if (fs.statSync(childPath).isDirectory()) {
      scanNode(childPath);                        // recurse into branch nodes
    }
  }
}

This gives you:

    Full control via _sflow/ to include any folder as a mesh node.

    Explicit terminal behavior via _sf-terminal/.

    Automatic inclusion of any folder that already carries its own RDF (distribution file).

With this, your weave process cleanly builds the semantic mesh and stops precisely where you intend—no extra markers needed.
You said:
But there are pros to making every non-terminal node a container. 

/ns/myDataset/ doesn't list the distributions, the only non-system file in there is the current distribution. That's true of regular-datasets and sf-datasets. So I feel like there's plenty of room to contain other nodes. You can't just drop files in there anyhow, everything has to be a folder.

Regarding _v1..._vN next to _v... they all line up! And they're all terminal, i.e. regular-datasets.
ChatGPT said:

You’re right—treating every non-terminal node as a true container opens up some neat possibilities:

    Uniform container semantics

        Branch nodes (namespaces, SF-datasets, reference-nodes) all behave the same: they hold exactly one “live” distribution file (the current .trig/.ttl) and any number of child mesh nodes in sub-folders.

        You simply forbid dropping arbitrary files in a branch: if it’s not a system folder (_sflow/, _v/, _sf-terminal/) or the one allowed distribution, it must be a sub-folder (another node).

    Clear UX in /ns/myDataset/

/ns/myDataset/
├─ myDataset.trig     ← current distribution
├─ _sflow/            ← SF-config
├─ _v/                ← history marker
│
├─ childNodeA/
│   └─ …              ← nested mesh node
└─ childNodeB/
    └─ …  

    The directory lists exactly one file plus folders. Anyone scanning visually knows “this is a branch—I can look inside for sub-nodes or versions.”

Sibling _v and v1…vN

    /ns/myDataset/
    ├─ _v/                ← “history closet” marker (terminal)
    ├─ v1/               ← version 1 snapshot (terminal)
    ├─ v2/               ← version 2 snapshot (terminal)
    └─ myDataset.trig     ← live distribution

        Pro: all version folders line up at the same level for instant visual comparison.

        Pro: since both _v/ and each vN/ are marked terminal (_sf-terminal/ or by convention), the scanner skips them entirely when recursing.

        Con: you lose the nice REST path /…/_v/v1/… semantics—instead clients must know “look for /v1/… siblings of _v/.”

    Terminal vs. container remains explicit

        Any folder with _sflow/ but without _sf-terminal/ is a branch node and can contain more nodes or exactly one live .trig file.

        Folders marked _sf-terminal/, or any version snapshot folders (vN/), are pure leaves: may contain only the distribution file, no further recursion.

Why this hybrid approach works

    Consistency: all branch nodes look the same on disk—one file + folders.

    Flexibility: SF-datasets can nest namespaces or reference-nodes as needed; regular-datasets remain thin leaves if you omit _sflow/.

    Clarity: sibling version folders “line up” for easy browsing, and the scanner’s logic stays simple:

        Find folders with _sflow/ → branch node.

        Skip folders with _sf-terminal/ or named vN under version branches.

        Treat any other sub-folder as a nested branch node.

In short, by making every branch node a strict container (one live file + sub-folders) and adopting the sibling v1…vN pattern, you get both the clean visual alignment you want and a simple recursion rule—no accidental nodes hidden under datasets, and terminal/version folders never confuse the mesh builder.
You said:
actually, I've been operating under the assumption that reference-nodes don't have a distribution file and are not datasets. That's mostly because I don't want their IRIs to refer to a thing and a dataset. Instead of sticking their metadata (really, data about their referent), inside a _ref folder, we could consider putting it into the _sflow/ folder.

namespace-nodes also haven't been conceptualized as datasets. 

So in summary, we can't treat them all the same in every way, but we could treat them all as containers.

Regarding _v, I'd say the versions are sf-folders, so should begin with underscore.

Part of the reason to nest the _v1 folders inside _v is to hide potentially-long version lists. That's a good reason. But I don't think we lose any semantics.  

_sflow and _sf-terminal folders are mutually exclusive. You can't have both. I think every system-folder should be terminal. 
ChatGPT said:

Here’s a concise restatement of the revised rules and how your node types fit together under the “everything’s a folder” principle—while keeping all system‐folders terminal and all nodes uniform containers:
1 System-folders (all terminal)
Folder	Purpose
_sflow/	SF-config & metadata (for reference-nodes, namespace-nodes, sf-datasets)
_sf-terminal/	Explicit “leaf” marker—stop recursion here
_v/	Version-series “closet” (hides long lists of versions)

    Mutual exclusion:

        A folder may contain exactly one of these three (or none).

        If it has _sflow/ → it’s an SF-Node (branch or leaf).

        If it has _sf-terminal/ → it’s a leaf node (terminal).

        If it has _v/ → it’s an SF-Dataset with version history.

2 Node types as pure containers

Every mesh-node is simply “a folder marked by one of those system-folders” and may also contain child folders that are themselves mesh-nodes. Nothing else goes in a branch node.
Node category	System-folder	May contain children?	May contain data file?
Namespace-Node	_sflow/	Yes	Optional (e.g. a namespace.ttl)
Reference-Node	_sflow/	Yes	No (its metadata lives in _sflow/)
SF-Dataset	_sflow/ + _v/ or just _sflow/ if unversioned	Yes	Exactly one live distribution (*.trig/ttl/jsonld)
Branch-Leaf	_sflow/ + _sf-terminal/	No	Optional (if it’s also a dataset)
Version snapshot	_v/ + _sf-terminal/	No	Exactly one frozen distribution

    Regular-Dataset (no _sflow/): lives under an SF-Node as a pure leaf folder, marked by _sf-terminal/ if you’d like, but otherwise just a folder containing one file.

3 Hiding version lists

By nesting your numbered versions under _v/:

/myNode/
├─ _v/                    ← terminal folder (no recursion)
│   ├─ v1/                ← terminal snapshot
│   ├─ v2/                ← terminal snapshot
│   └─ …  
└─ (other system-folders or child nodes)

    UI benefit: all vN/ line up and are tucked under _v/, so casual directory listings don’t explode with dozens of siblings.

    Semantics intact: clients still know “look under _v/ for historic snapshots.”

4 Why this makes sense

    Uniform container model
    Every node—whether a namespace, reference proxy, or dataset—is “just a folder with exactly one system-folder.”

    Explicit terminality
    No more guessing which branches are leaves: _sf-terminal/ or _v/ → end of the road.

    Metadata co-location
    Reference-node metadata now lives in _sflow/, not in a separate _ref/.

    Minimal special cases
    No more _id/ and _ref/ loops; you’ve replaced them with one clean marker.

    Scannable and predictable
    Weave’s scanner simply looks for system-folders, recurses into branch nodes, and skips terminals.

Example tree

/ns/
└─ myDataset/
   ├─ _sflow/               ← SF-config (versioningPolicy, templates…)
   ├─ counts.trig           ← live distribution
   ├─ _v/                   ← history closet (terminal)
   │   ├─ v1/
   │   │   ├─ counts.trig   ← snapshot v1 (terminal)
   │   │   └─ _sf-terminal/
   │   └─ v2/
   │       └─ counts.trig   ← snapshot v2
   ├─ childConcept/         ← nested branch node
   │   └─ _sflow/
   └─ docs/                 ← **ignored** (no system-folder here)

Feel free to tweak names (e.g. _leaf/ instead of _sf-terminal/), but this structure gives you exactly:

    Branch vs. leaf clarity

    Clean version hiding

    Unified container semantics with minimal folder types.

You said:
don't forget the other system folders, "_ref" and "_assets". Also, I think you forgot that _sflow/ and _sf-terminal/ are mutually exclusive.

ChatGPT said:

Let’s fold all five system-folders into one unified matrix, and call out that _sflow/ and _sf-terminal/ can’t co-exist:
System-folder	Purpose	Terminal?	Exclusive with
_sflow/	Marks an SF-Node (namespace, reference-node, or SF-dataset); holds config & metadata	No	_sf-terminal/
_sf-terminal/	Explicit leaf marker—stop recursion here	Yes	_sflow/, _v/
_v/	Version-series closet for SF-datasets or referent datasets; hides long lists of snapshots	Yes	_sf-terminal/
_ref/	Referent dataset container for Reference-Nodes (holds the “about X” distributions)	No	—
_assets/	Pure asset bundle (images, CSS, binaries)—always terminal and ignored by the mesh scanner	Yes	—
Node types & allowed combinations

    Namespace-Node

        Must have _sflow/

        May nest child SF-Nodes

        May optionally include a namespace-describing RDF file named <folderName>.<ext>

    Reference-Node

        Must have _sflow/ and a _ref/ subfolder

        _ref/ may itself contain _v/ for versioned referent data

        No direct data file in the parent folder

    SF-Dataset

        Must have _sflow/

        Must contain exactly one live distribution (*.trig|ttl|jsonld)

        May have _v/ for history (snapshots under _v/ are terminal)

    Branch-Leaf Node

        Must have either _sflow/ or _sf-terminal/ (never both)

        If _sf-terminal/, it’s a leaf: no children, no _v/

    Version Snapshot

        Lives under a _v/ folder

        Must be marked terminal (_sf-terminal/ or by inference)

        Contains exactly one frozen distribution

    Regular-Dataset (terminal)

        A folder with a single distribution file (no system-folders)

        May optionally carry _sf-terminal/ to make it explicit

    Asset Folder

        Must have _assets/

        Terminal by definition: no mesh recursion

Mutual-exclusion rules

    _sflow/ and _sf-terminal/ never appear together in the same folder.

    _sf-terminal/ and _v/ are mutually exclusive (snapshots under _v/ are already terminal).

With this you have a consistent, complete map of system-folders and how they shape your mesh.
You said:
Let's call "_v" instead "_v-series". It is the sf-datasetseries (also a regular dataset) that defines the version history. 

_vN should live next to it so that all system folders are terminal.

I think we need to separate out the sflow config from _sflow/_sf-terminal. 

Can we git _sf-terminal a more concise name? like _noflow maybe? It's be better if it didn't have the word "flow" in it.
ChatGPT said:

Here’s a consolidated proposal with your tweaks in place:
1 System-folders (all terminal except the SF-node marker)
Folder	Role	Terminal?	Mutually exclusive with
_sflow/	Marks an SF-node (namespace-node, reference-node, or SF-dataset) — no config here, just a flag	No	_leaf/
_leaf/	Explicit “stop recursion” marker (formerly _sf-terminal/)	Yes	_sflow/, _v-series/
_v-series/	History “closet” for an SF-dataset (hides all the v1/,v2/,…)	Yes	_leaf/
v1/,v2/…	Version snapshots — siblings of _v-series/, each terminal	Yes	—
_ref/	Referent-metadata dataset (for reference-nodes)	No	—
_assets/	Asset bundles (images, CSS, binaries) — pure leaves	Yes	—
_sflow-config/	SF config & template maps — separate from the mesh, ignored by scanner	Yes	—
2 Folder-shapes & node types

    Branch-Node (SF-Node)

        Contains _sflow/ (leaf without _leaf/)

        May have:

            a single RDF file named <folderName>.<ext> (making it an SF-dataset)

            child SF-Nodes (sub-folders with their own _sflow/)

            optionally _ref/ (if it’s a reference-node)

    SF-Dataset (a special Branch-Node)

        Has _sflow/

        Has one live distribution (*.trig/*.ttl/*.jsonld)

        May have _v-series/ + sibling vN/ for versions

    Reference-Node

        A Branch-Node with a _ref/ sub-folder (which itself may be an SF-Dataset)

        No data file at the parent level

    Terminal Node

        Has _leaf/ (never _sflow/ or _v-series/)

        May have one RDF file named <folderName>.<ext> (optional)

        No children

    Version Snapshots

        v1/, v2/, … live next to _v-series/

        Each must be marked terminal (by inference or with its own _leaf/)

    Assets

        Any folder named _assets/ is terminal and ignored by the mesh scanner.

    Config

        All SF-config files live under _sflow-config/, never under _sflow/ or any other system folder.

3 Why this works

    Single inclusion marker (_sflow/) for every mesh node.

    Explicit leaf marker (_leaf/) that’s short, easy to spot, and contains no “flow” jargon.

    Clean version hiding under _v-series/ with aligned vN/ siblings.

    Config fully externalized in _sflow-config/ so neither marker folder doubles as a config container.

    Uniform container model: every branch node holds exactly one RDF file (if it’s a dataset) and/or child folders that are themselves SF-nodes.

4 Quick scanner sketch

function isMeshNode(dir) {
  return fs.existsSync(path.join(dir, '_sflow'));
}

function scan(dir) {
  for (let sub of fs.readdirSync(dir, { withFileTypes: true })) {
    if (!sub.isDirectory()) continue;
    const p = path.join(dir, sub.name);

    if (fs.existsSync(path.join(p, '_leaf'))) {
      processNode(p);           // terminal, but still a node
      continue;                 // no recursion
    }
    if (fs.existsSync(path.join(p, '_sflow'))) {
      processNode(p);           // branch node
      scan(p);                  // recurse into children
    }
  }
}

With these names and rules, your directory layout is:

/ns/myDataset/
├─ myDataset.trig          ← live data
├─ _sflow/                 ← SF-node marker
├─ _v-series/              ← version-series closet
├─ v1/                     ← version snapshot (terminal)
├─ v2/                     ← version snapshot (terminal)
├─ childNode/              ← nested SF-node
│   └─ _sflow/
├─ _leaf/                  ← would mark this as a terminal node
└─ _sflow-config/          ← config + templates (ignored by the mesh)

Feel free to tweak any name—_leaf/ and _v-series/ are just suggestions—but this should give you the concise, non-recursive, and semantically clear structure you’re after.
You said:
maybe we don't need _leaf? We can assume that if _sflow/ isn't present, the folder is terminal.

instead of _sflow/ let's use _sf-container/ or something more concise like ??? -- it's mostly for users looking at a directory listing so its name should say what it does.

Let's keep _v* inside _v-series again -- we can't have users and UIs having to deal with potentially hundreds of _v* folder in what should be an uncluttered node folder. System datasets including _vseries are regular-datasets , and so terminal in the sense of non-container, but they can contain _v* datasets which aren't really user. 

also, distribution can just be named for the parent folder everywhere, except for the _v* distributions. You lose consistency, but it's helpful for users. So _v* datasets are exceptional in two ways:
- they are allowed in otherwise-termainal _v-series folders
- their distribution names include the great-grandparent name (instead of the  parent name) plus their parent folder name, e.g. my-dataset_v1.trig
ChatGPT said:

Here’s the fully updated layout, folding in all your preferences:
1 System-folders and markers
Folder	Role	Recursion?
_mesh/	Marks branch mesh-nodes (namespaces, reference-nodes, SF-datasets)	Yes
_assets/	Asset bundles (images, CSS, binaries)—always terminal, ignored	No
_ref/	Referent-metadata SF-dataset (for reference-nodes)	Yes¹
_v-series/	Version “closet” for SF-datasets: hides the v1/, v2/, … underneath	No²
v1/, v2/, …	Version snapshots—siblings of _v-series/, each terminal	No
no marker	Any folder without _mesh/ (or one of the above) is a terminal-node	No

¹ You recurse into _ref/ so you can discover its versions (if any).
² _v-series/ itself is terminal (you list its vN/ children but do not recurse further).
2 Distribution-naming rules

    Branch nodes (with _mesh/):

        Live distribution named after the folder:

    /ns/MyDataset/
    └─ MyDataset.trig

Version snapshots (vN/ under _v-series/):

    Distribution file named <BranchName>_vN.ext:

        /ns/MyDataset/_v-series/
        ├─ v1/  
        │   └─ MyDataset_v1.trig  
        └─ v2/  
            └─ MyDataset_v2.trig  

    Regular-datasets (no _mesh/):

        Single file inside their folder, any name you like, but typically <FolderName>.trig.

3 Node categories & contents
Node type	Marker	May contain RDF?	May contain child nodes?
Branch node	_mesh/	Optional (as a SF-dataset)	Yes
Reference-node	_mesh/ + _ref/	No (its RDF lives in _ref/)	Yes
SF-Dataset	_mesh/	Yes (one live file)	Yes
Version snapshot	under _v-series/	Yes (one frozen file)	No
Terminal-node	no marker	Optional (one file)	No
Assets	_assets/	No	No
4 Recursion logic (pseudo-code)

function scanNode(dir) {
  // Branch if it has a _mesh/ marker
  if (!fs.existsSync(path.join(dir, '_mesh'))) {
    return processTerminal(dir);
  }
  processBranch(dir);

  for (let child of fs.readdirSync(dir, { withFileTypes: true })) {
    const p = path.join(dir, child.name);
    if (!child.isDirectory()) continue;

    if (child.name === '_v-series') {
      listVersions(p);          // show v1, v2, … but do NOT recurse inside them
      continue;
    }
    if (child.name === '_ref') {
      scanSFData(p);            // optional: recurse to gather referent versions
      continue;
    }
    if (child.name === '_assets') {
      continue;                 // skip assets
    }
    // any other folder under a branch with _mesh/ is a nested node
    scanNode(p);
  }
}

5 Why this hits your goals

    Single, clear branch-marker (_mesh/) tells Weave “this is part of the mesh.”

    No separate leaf marker—anything without _mesh/ is terminal, so users see a clean directory.

    Versions neatly hidden under _v-series/, preventing directory bloat.

    Distribution names follow an intuitive pattern, with _<version> only on snapshots.

    All system folders are terminal (except _mesh/), so no accidental deep recursion.

    Config fully decoupled in your existing _sflow-config/ (or wherever you choose), leaving _mesh/ purely as an inclusion flag.

This gives you a minimal, self-documenting folder grammar that’s both UI-friendly and tooling-friendly. Let me know if you’d like any tweaks!

_mesh is good. 

Yes, if we acknowledge the system folders are always terminal (with that caveat that _v-series get a bonus level for the version) and prohibit _ref in _v-series, I think we avoid the infinite looping.

_v1, _v2 are no longer siblings, put em back in _v-series.

regular dataset should have _mesh. Why not? It's only system-datasets that don't have _mesh.

Here’s the distilled, final folder‐grammar that matches everything you’ve asked for:
1 System‐folders (all terminal)

    _mesh/
    – Branch‐marker: “this folder is an SF‐Node”
    – Only present on branch nodes (namespaces, reference‐nodes, SF‐datasets)
    – Mutually exclusive with all other system folders

    _ref/
    – Referent SF‐Dataset (holds your “about X” triples)
    – Terminal in the sense of “no further child SF‐Nodes” (but you do scan its distributions & versions)

    _v-series/
    – Version‐history closet for SF‐datasets (_ref or data)
    – Terminal: you list its v1/,v2/,… children but do not recurse past them

    _assets/
    – Static assets (images, CSS, binaries)
    – Fully ignored by the mesh scanner

    No other system folder—every one of these is terminal (no further SF‐Node children).

2 Where versions live

/someNode/
├─ _mesh/             ← this is a branch
├─ data.trig          ← “live” RDF distribution (if it’s an SF‐Dataset)
├─ _v-series/         ← history closet (terminal)
│   ├─ v1/
│   │   └─ someNode_v1.trig   ← snapshot #1 (terminal)
│   └─ v2/
│       └─ someNode_v2.trig   ← snapshot #2 (terminal)
└─ childNode/         ← nested SF‐Node (must have its own _mesh/)
    └─ _mesh/

    _v-series/ sits beside your live file.

    vN/ folders live inside it (no more siblings at the top level).

    Both _v-series/ and each vN/ are terminal (stop recursion there).

3 Branch vs. Terminal SF‐Nodes

    Branch SF‐Node = a folder containing _mesh/ (and no other system folder)

        May contain:

            One live distribution named <FolderName>.<ext> (making it an SF‐Dataset)

            _ref/ if it’s a Reference‐Node

            _v-series/ if it’s a versioned SF‐Dataset

            Child SF‐Nodes (subfolders with their own _mesh/)

    Terminal SF‐Node = a folder without _mesh/ but which is:

        A vN/ snapshot under _v-series/, or

        A _ref/ folder (you process its data but don’t recurse into nested nodes), or

        A _assets/ folder (ignored entirely)

    Regular‐Dataset = pure content leaf (no _mesh/), just a single .trig|ttl|jsonld file in the folder

4 Scanner pseudocode

function scanNode(dir) {
  // Must be a branch to recurse
  if (!fs.existsSync(path.join(dir, '_mesh'))) {
    return processTerminal(dir);
  }
  processBranch(dir);

  for (let child of fs.readdirSync(dir, { withFileTypes: true })) {
    if (!child.isDirectory()) continue;
    const p = path.join(dir, child.name);

    switch (child.name) {
      case '_assets':
        continue;                   // skip assets
      case '_ref':
        processDataset(p);          // load its distributions & versions
        continue;                   // terminal
      case '_v-series':
        listVersions(p);            // show v1, v2… but no recursion into them
        continue;                   // terminal
      default:
        // nested SF‐Node must have its own _mesh/
        scanNode(p);
    }
  }
}

5 Key takeaways

    _mesh/ is your one true branch‐marker—every SF‐Node (including datasets and reference‐nodes) gets it.

    All other system folders (_ref/, _v-series/, _assets/) are terminal—they don’t host further SF‐Nodes beneath them.

    Version snapshots (vN/) live inside _v-series/, preserving an uncluttered top‐level folder.

    Regular datasets are terminal leaves (no _mesh/)—everything “user‐facing” has to opt into the mesh by adding _mesh/.

This gives you a uniform container model, clear recursion rules, and a tidy directory layout for both users and tools.
You said:
_mesh tells Weave "this folder can contain other user-nodes"

_mesh is terminal too, it can't contain user-nodes itself. Or anything else for that matter. Maybe we should differentiate between system-terminal, user-terminal, and terminal (both user and system). _ref is user-terminal, _ref/v-series is user-terminal, _ref/v-series/v1/ is terminal

user-nodes vs system-nodes doesn't quite capture things perfectly because _assets feels like a system-node with its non-extensibility and underscore, but it's for users
ChatGPT said:

Let’s untangle the layers by splitting everything into system-folders (pure tooling/structure) vs user-nodes (your mesh), and by recognizing that only user-nodes can branch—system-folders are always terminal.
A System-folders (always terminal)
Name	Role	Recursed?	Contains user-nodes?
_mesh/	Marker that its parent folder is a branch node	No	No
_ref/	Referent-dataset container for a Reference-Node	No	No
_v-series/	“History closet” for versioned SF-datasets (hides v1/,v2/,…)	No	No
_assets/	Asset bundle (images, CSS, etc.)—ignored by the mesh scanner	No	No

    Key: We never recurse into these folders. They’re purely system containers.

B User-nodes

All user-nodes are folders outside of those system-folders. They come in two flavors:

    Branch Node

        Must contain a _mesh/ subfolder.

        May contain any combination of:

            A single live distribution file named <FolderName>.<ext> (making it an SF-Dataset)

            A _ref/ folder (making it a Reference-Node)

            A _v-series/ folder + its vN/ snapshots (making it versioned)

            Other user-node subfolders (nested branch or terminal nodes)

    Terminal Node

        Must not contain a _mesh/ subfolder.

        Detected by having at least one distribution file (*.trig|ttl|jsonld) or by being a version snapshot folder (v1/, v2/, … under _v-series/).

        Contains no child user-nodes.

C Recursion rules

scan(dir):
  for each child folder C in dir:
    if C is one of the system-folders (_mesh, _ref, _v-series, _assets):
      processSystemFolder(C)   # load distributions, versions, etc.
    else if C contains a _mesh/ subfolder:
      processBranchNode(C)
      scan(C)                  # recurse into child user-nodes
    else if C is a distribution folder (has a file named C.*):
      processTerminalNode(C)   # leaf, do not recurse
    else:
      ignore(C)                # neither mesh nor system nor data

    scan only recurses into branch nodes (folders with _mesh/).

    Terminal nodes and system-folders stop the descent.

D Why this solves the loops and keeps things clear

    System-folders are untouchable leaves. There’s no _mesh/ inside _v-series/ or _ref/, so you can never “version the versioner.”

    Branch nodes are the only expanders. We know exactly where nesting can happen: in any folder that opted into the mesh (via _mesh/).

    Terminal nodes auto-stop. If you see no _mesh/ but you see a data file or a vN/ folder, you know it’s a leaf.

    Consistency across types. Whether it’s a namespace, dataset, or reference proxy, you treat it the same if it has _mesh/.

    Users never clutter top levels. _v-series/ hides version lists; assets live in _assets/.

E Visual summary

/ns/
└─ MyDataset/              ← **Branch Node** (has _mesh/)
   ├─ _mesh/               ← system-folder, terminal
   ├─ MyDataset.trig       ← live distribution (SF-Dataset)
   ├─ _v-series/           ← system-folder, terminal (history closet)
   │   ├─ v1/              ← **Terminal Node** (version snapshot)
   │   │   └─ MyDataset_v1.trig
   │   └─ v2/
   │       └─ MyDataset_v2.trig
   ├─ _ref/                ← system-folder, terminal (referent dataset)
   │   └─ MyDataset_ref.trig
   ├─ Assets/              ← system-folder, terminal
   ├─ ChildConcept/        ← **Branch Node** (has _mesh/)
   │   └─ _mesh/
   │       └─ …  
   └─ OtherFolder/         ← ignored (no _mesh/, no data)

This gives you:

    A single inclusion flag (_mesh/) for all branch-capable user nodes.

    Four system-folders that are always terminal and never nest user-nodes.

    A clear cut between branch nodes (recurse) and terminal nodes (leaf).

With this in hand, your scanner can be both blazingly simple and bullet-proof against infinite‐loop versioning or accidental deep scans.
You said:
system-folders aren't always terminal. _ref/ and _v-series for example are user-terminal but not terminal. I don't think any others. _assets are system folders, even though they contain arguably user-data, because. "branch node" is okay but kinda overloaded when versioning is around. it's really a "user-node-container" node. I'm not sure what the column "recursed" refers to... but _ref can contain _v-series so the weave process has to recurse it. same for v-series
ChatGPT said:

You’re right—our old “Recursed?” column conflated two very different walks:

    User‐node walk: “Which folders do we recurse into to find nested user nodes (i.e. things, namespaces, SF‐datasets)?”

    Dataset walk: “Once we hit a user‐node, which system‐folders do we recurse into to gather distributions and versions?”

Let’s split them out clearly.
A Folder types
Folder	Role
_mesh/	Marker: its parent is a user‐node‐container
_assets/	System‐assets—ignored by all scans
_ref/	Referent‐dataset container (holds metadata RDF)
_v-series/	Version‐series container for a dataset
vN/	A single version snapshot (e.g. v1/, v2/)
B User-node walk (find nested user-nodes)

    Recurse into: any folder that has a _mesh/ child.

    Stop at: all other folders (including _ref/, _v-series/, vN/, _assets/).

scanUserNodes(dir):
  for each sub-folder F:
    if exists(F/_mesh):
      processUserNode(F)
      scanUserNodes(F)        ← only here we recurse
    else:
      ignore F

C Dataset walk (inside a user-node)

Once you’ve landed on a user‐node (a folder with _mesh/), you need to pick up:

    Live distribution (file named <FolderName>.<ext>)

    Referent dataset (_ref/)

    Version history (_v-series/ with its vN/ children)

processUserNode(dir):
  if exists(dir/_ref):
    scanDataset(dir/_ref)          ← recurse into _ref for its versions
  if exists(dir/<name>.<ext>):
    scanDataset(dir)                ← this folder is also a dataset

And…

scanDataset(datasetDir):
  if exists(datasetDir/_v-series):
    for each sub-folder V under _v-series:
      recordSnapshot(V)            ← list v1, v2, …
      // DO NOT recurse further into V
  recordLiveDistribution(datasetDir)

    We do recurse into _ref/ because it may itself have _v-series/.

    We recurse into _v-series/ only to list its vN/ children, but then stop.

D Putting it all together
Folder	User-node walk?	Dataset walk?	Holds user-nodes?	Holds distributions?
_mesh/	No	No	No	No
_assets/	No	No	No	No
<Node>/	Yes (if _mesh/)	Yes	Yes	Maybe (if <Name>.<ext> exists)
_ref/	No	Yes	No	Yes
_v-series/	No	Yes (list vN/)	No	No (its children do)
vN/	No	No	No	Yes (snapshot file)

    User-node containers are only those with _mesh/.

    Terminal user-nodes are those user folders without _mesh/ but with a distribution file (or that appear under _v-series/ as vN/).

    System-folders (_ref/, _v-series/, _assets/) never spawn new user-nodes, but _ref/ and _v-series/ are recursed into during the dataset walk to discover metadata and versions.

Why this clears things up

    No infinite loops: system-folders never look like user-nodes.

    Two clear passes: one for node topology, one for dataset topology.

    _ref/ and _v-series/ are correctly recursed, but only in the context of gathering RDF distributions and snapshots—not to find nested “user” nodes.

    _assets/ remains purely ignored.

This separation keeps both your mesh‐building and your version/distribution‐gathering logic simple and bullet-proof.
