In Semantic Flow, a namespace [[resource|sflow.concepts.resource]]  is the path (or URL fragment) under which identifiers and datasets can live. 

Basically, namespaces are just folders. They can be used to contextualize their contained resources. 

- a [[sflow.concepts.sf-repo]] allows you to publish namespaces on a static site hosting service 
- a [[sflow.concepts.sf-data-repo]] can be woven into multiple namespaces
  - this allows, for example, a namespace initially minted in one repo to get picked up in another one.
