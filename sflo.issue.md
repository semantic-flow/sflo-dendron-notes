- the [[sflo.concept.mesh.resource.element.documentation-resource.resource-page]] gets returned for two different URLs, (the folder and the full index.html). Maybe could have some client-side path detection that alters the content:
  - if "index.html" this URL refers to the resource page presented below
  - if not, "this URL refers to to djradon the person"
