A node's **aggregated distribution** is a compilation of all the data datasets of all its contained nodes, situated directly under the node for easy access with an intuitive filename of "nodename.ext".

## Purpose

Aggregated distributions enable **composable semantic data** by:
- Combining component data nodes into unified resources
- Providing complete datasets for external consumption
- Supporting modular ontology and knowledge base construction
- Maintaining component independence while enabling composition

## Generation Process

During [[sflo.concept.weave-process]], aggregated distributions are created by:
1. **Scanning contained data nodes** recursively within the mesh structure
2. **Collecting `_data/_current/` distributions** from each component
3. **Merging content** with proper URI resolution and prefix handling
4. **Excluding `_ref` and `_meta` datasets** (data content only)
5. **Generating multiple distributions** (.ttl, .rdf, .jsonld) as configured

## Examples

### Composable Ontology
```
/my-ontology/
├── my-ontology.ttl              ← Aggregated distribution
├── my-ontology.rdf              ← Aggregated distribution  
├── my-ontology.jsonld           ← Aggregated distribution
├── components/
│   ├── Person/                  ← Data node (class definition)
│   ├── hasName/                 ← Data node (property definition)
│   └── Organization/            ← Data node (class definition)
```

### Knowledge Base
```
/biotech-kb/
├── biotech-kb.ttl               ← Aggregated distribution
├── biotech-kb.jsonld            ← Aggregated distribution
├── companies/
│   ├── genentech/               ← Company data node
│   └── moderna/                 ← Company data node
└── products/
    ├── drug-x/                  ← Product data node
    └── vaccine-y/               ← Product data node
```

## Technical Considerations

**Merging logic handles:**
- **Relative path resolution** - Converting component-relative URIs to absolute
- **Prefix consolidation** - Deduplicating namespace declarations
- **Graph merging** - Combining RDF graphs from multiple sources; de-dupingz
- **Base URI handling** - Ensuring consistent URI resolution

## Use Cases

- **Ontologies** - Classes and properties from component nodes
- **Vocabularies** - Terms and definitions from specialized nodes  
- **Catalogs** - Dataset metadata from multiple sources
- **Knowledge bases** - Facts distributed across domain-specific nodes
- **Configuration data** - Settings aggregated from component services
