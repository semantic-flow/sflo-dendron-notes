- a mesh is structured with folders, which correspond to URL paths when published.

## Rejected options

- directories: longer to type and most people just say folders
- URLs/IRIs: a mesh is local-first, and we don't use the "file:// schema" so it doesn't make sense to call these things URLs
- folder names are used for identifiers, but identifiers are contextualized with their containing path. if you're not talking about the whole path, it's really just a folder.
