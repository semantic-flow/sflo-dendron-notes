# Semantic Mesh Concepts Summary

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the core concepts of the Semantic Flow framework and the "semantic mesh" architecture, intended for AI/LLM consumption.

## 0. Twin Purposes

- minting IRIs for referring to things on the semantic web
- holding semantic data or datasets that use those IRIs.

## 1. What is a Semantic Mesh?

A **semantic mesh** is a dereferenceable, optionally-versioned collection of semantic data and supporting resources, where every HTTP URL returns meaningful content. It's a framework for managing and publishing knowledge graphs and other Semantic Web resources. Meshes are designed to be stored in Git repositories and can be published as static websites.

### Key Characteristics:

-   **Addressable**: Every resource has a unique URL-based identifier.
-   **Dereferenceable**: All URLs resolve to meaningful content.
-   **Versioned**: Changes to data are managed through a "weave process," and data flows are versioned by default.
-   **Publish-ready**: A mesh repository can be served directly as a static website (e.g., via GitHub Pages).
-   **Transposable**: A mesh can be moved to different serving locations without breaking its internal structure.
-   **Composable**: Multiple meshes can be combined, or sub-meshes can be extracted to create new, functional semantic structures.

## 2. Core Components

A mesh is composed of two primary types of resources: **Nodes** and **Elements**.

### 2.1. Mesh Nodes

**Nodes** are the primary structural components of a mesh, physically represented as folders. They are extensible containers for other nodes and elements.

There are three types of nodes:

1.  **Namespace Node**: The simplest type of node, acting as an organizational container (a folder) for other nodes. Its URL refers to the namespace itself.
2.  **Reference Node**: Represents an external entity or concept (e.g., a person, a place, an idea). Its URL refers to that external entity. It contains a `_ref-flow` to hold data about the entity.
3.  **Data Node**: Represents a dataset or a data concept. Its URL refers to the abstract dataset. It contains a `_data-flow` to hold the actual data.

Every node, regardless of type, must contain a `_meta-flow` (for metadata) and a `_handle` (a special element for referring to the node itself as a mesh resource).

### 2.2. Mesh Elements

**Elements** are terminal resources that support and define nodes. They cannot contain other nodes.

Key elements include:

-   **Flows**: Abstract, evolvable datasets that hold content for a node. They are `dcat:DatasetSeries`. There are several types:
    -   `_meta-flow`: Contains administrative and structural metadata about the node, including provenance and versioning information.
    -   `_ref-flow`: Contains data about the entity a Reference Node refers to.
    -   `_data-flow`: Contains the "payload" data for a Data Node.
    -   `_config-flow`: Contains configuration settings for a node.
-   **Snapshots**: Concrete, temporal slices of a Flow. They are `dcat:Dataset`.
    -   `_current`: The stable, published version of the data.
    -   `_next`: A draft workspace for changes.
    -   `_vN`: Immutable, historical version snapshots (e.g., `_v1`, `_v2`).
-   **Handle (`_handle`)**: A special element that refers to its containing node "as a mesh resource" rather than what the node's URL refers to. This is crucial for metadata and management operations.
-   **Asset Tree (`_assets`)**: A folder for arbitrary non-mesh files (images, CSS, etc.) that are associated with a node.
-   **Documentation Resources**:
    -   **Resource Page (`index.html`)**: A human-readable page for every folder-based resource, generated by the weave process.
    -   **README.md / CHANGELOG.md**: User-provided documentation.

## 3. Structure and Naming

-   **Physical Structure**: The mesh is a directory structure. Nodes are folders. Elements are typically folders with underscore prefixes (e.g., `_meta-flow`, `_assets`).
-   **Logical Structure (Namespace)**: The folder hierarchy creates a URL namespace. The folder name of a resource becomes a segment in its URL.
-   **Identifiers**:
    -   **URL**: The full, absolute address of a resource when published. URLs ending in a slash (`/`) refer to concepts (Nodes, Flows). URLs ending in a filename refer to content (Distributions, documentation).
    -   **Relative Identifier**: The path to a resource relative to the mesh root, used for internal linking to ensure transposability.

## 4. Key Processes and Concepts

### 4.1. The Weave Process

The **weave process** is an automated operation that maintains the integrity and consistency of the mesh. Its key functions include:
-   Creating missing system elements (like resource pages).
-   For versioned flows, creating new `_vN` version snapshots from the `_next` snapshot.
-   Copying the contents of `_next` to `_current` to publish changes.
-   Updating the `_meta-flow` with new provenance and versioning information.
-   Generating aggregated and unified datasets.
-   Resolving broken internal links to ensure transposability.

### 4.2. Versioning and Immutability

-   Only **Flows** can be versioned.
-   Versioning is controlled by settings in a node's `_config-flow`.
-   When a versioned flow is woven, a new, immutable `_vN` snapshot is created.
-   The `_current` snapshot represents the latest stable version, while `_next` is the mutable working directory.
-   This provides a stable reference for external systems while allowing ongoing development.

### 4.3. Configuration

-   Node behavior (versioning, distribution formats, etc.) is controlled by its `_config-flow`.
-   Configuration can be inherited from parent nodes, service-level settings, or platform-wide defaults.
-   This allows for both global consistency and granular, per-node control.

### 4.4. Provenance

-   Provenance is recorded in the `_meta-flow` for each immutable version snapshot (`_vN`).
-   It captures the activities (e.g., `WeaveActivity`), agents, and delegation chains involved in creating a version.
-   This provides a detailed audit trail for all data changes.

## 5. Inconsistencies and Areas for Improvement

-   Several documentation files are empty or incomplete.
-   Some AI-generated content is marked as needing re-verification.
-   There are minor terminological inconsistencies (e.g., "layer" vs. "snapshot").
-   Some technical details, like the distinction between a versioned component and a dataset-series, could be clarified.
