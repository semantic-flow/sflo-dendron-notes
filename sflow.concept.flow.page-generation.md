- theoretically every resource [[sflow.concept.mesh.resource.file.resource-page]] could look
  different or even be generated by a different site generator
- instead of generating to a docs folder or branch, the index files can just be
  generated in-place!
- commit to main = publish!

## What Gets Included

- the [[sflow.concept.mesh.resource.file.readme]] would probably be the primary source in practice
- you could supplement AI-generated summaries

## Resolved Issues

- remove _x, we're doing publish-in-place
