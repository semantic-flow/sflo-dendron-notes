- supports the clients ([[sflo.product.flow-cli]] and [[sflo.product.flow-web]]) by keeping central control of mesh operations. It enables parallelism, which can speed up the weave and ensure processes don't clobber each others' work. It can also provide locking to allow multi-user or multi-client modification.

## Functions

- file watchers
- file locking

## Dependencies

- [[sflo.concept.mesh.database-file]]
