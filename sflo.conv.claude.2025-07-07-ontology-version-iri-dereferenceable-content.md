Semantic Flow /
sflo-ontology initial development...

is it true the Ontology Version IRI should actually return the ontology as a file? If so, what if you want to provide it in multiple syntaxes?

Edit
You're asking about a nuanced aspect of ontology versioning that gets into the weeds of semantic web best practices (.8).

The Ontology Version IRI should be dereferenceable and return the ontology content (.9), but there are different approaches for handling multiple syntaxes:

Standard approach:

The version IRI returns the ontology in a default format (typically RDF/XML or Turtle)
Use HTTP content negotiation to serve different formats based on Accept headers
This is the cleanest solution following REST principles
Alternative approaches:

Some use different URIs for different formats (e.g., myonto/v1.0.ttl, myonto/v1.0.rdf)
Others redirect to format-specific endpoints
Some provide a landing page with download links for different formats
Best practice recommendation (.85): Use the version IRI as the canonical identifier that returns content via content negotiation. This maintains URI stability while supporting multiple formats.

Are you implementing version IRIs for the first time, or dealing with an existing ontology that needs restructuring? Also, what's your target deployment environment - are you planning to host this yourself or use an existing ontology repository?

The approach might vary depending on whether you're building a simple file-based system or something more sophisticated with proper content negotiation.




I'm building a new ontology from scratch, and it has to be static-hostable at https://semantic-flow.github.io/sflo-ontology using a semantic mesh.

Can you access \\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\djradon\hub\semantic-flow\sf-workspace\sflo-dendron-notes\ ?

Edit
I cannot access that WSL path directly (.95). The filesystem tools I have access to are sandboxed and won't reach into your local WSL environment.

However, I can help you with the ontology hosting strategy for GitHub Pages. Since you're constrained to static hosting, here's what works:

For static hosting with multiple formats:

Use content negotiation via JavaScript (client-side)
Provide multiple file versions (e.g., ontology.ttl, ontology.rdf, ontology.jsonld)
Create a simple landing page that detects Accept headers or provides format selection
Use .htaccess rules if GitHub Pages supports them (it has limited support)
Semantic mesh approach:

You could set up redirects in your repository structure
Use a simple index.html that serves as a content negotiation endpoint
Or just document the different format URLs clearly
Would you like me to help design the directory structure and content negotiation approach for your static hosting?

Also, if you can copy/paste relevant files or directory contents from your WSL environment, I can help review your current setup and suggest improvements for the GitHub Pages deployment.

What format are you primarily authoring in - Turtle, RDF/XML, or something else?




Could content negotiation with client-side javascript really work? I'm skeptical.

You can access the documentation and notes at C:\Users\drich\hub\semantic-flow\sflo-dendron-notes but beware the sflo.conv* hierarchy, it is historical and contains many outdated decisions.

Edit
You're absolutely right to be skeptical (.9). Client-side JavaScript content negotiation is a hack at best - it can't access the original Accept headers that were sent to the server, so it's not true content negotiation.

Let me check what you have in your documentation:


F

list_directory


I can't access that path either - it seems I'm restricted to paths under C:\Users\drich\hub\djradon.

Back to your original question: For static hosting on GitHub Pages, your realistic options are:

Multiple explicit URIs - ontology.ttl, ontology.rdf, etc. Not ideal but pragmatic
Single format with clear documentation - Pick one canonical format (probably Turtle) and be done with it
Simple redirect page - A minimal HTML page that redirects based on query parameters or provides download links
The semantic web purists won't love option 1, but it's honest about the constraints of static hosting (.8).

Can you copy/paste your current ontology structure or the relevant documentation files? I'd like to understand what you're building before suggesting the best approach for the version IRI strategy.




now can you read C:\\Users\\drich\\hub\\semantic-flow\\sf-workspace

Edit

F

list_directory


Still can't access that path. Let me check what directories I can access:


F

list_allowed_directories


I'm restricted to just C:\Users\drich\hub\djradon.

To work around this, you could:

Copy the relevant files to the allowed directory
Just paste the content directly into the chat
Use the browser tools to navigate to the GitHub repository if it's already pushed
Which approach works better for you? I'm particularly interested in seeing your current ontology structure and any documentation about the version IRI strategy you're considering.




try again now.

Edit

F

list_directory


Getting closer! Let me check what's now available:


F

list_allowed_directories


Perfect! Now let me see what's in the semantic-flow directory:


F

list_directory


Hmm, that's odd. Let me try a different approach:


F

directory_tree


The filesystem access seems to be having issues. Could you try copying some key files (like your ontology files or documentation) to a path I can access, or just paste the relevant content directly?

I'm particularly interested in:

Your current ontology structure/files
Any documentation about versioning strategy
The planned directory structure for GitHub Pages hosting
This will help me give you concrete advice about the version IRI approach for static hosting.




The notes are in C:\Users\drich\hub\semantic-flow\sf-workspace\sflo-dendron-notes

Edit

F

list_directory


Let me try accessing from the parent directory:


F

list_directory


There's something unusual with the filesystem access - it shows c:\users\drich\hub\semantic-flow as allowed but can't access it. This might be a path resolution issue.

Could you try one of these approaches:

Copy files to accessible location: Copy your key notes/ontology files to a location I can definitely access
Direct paste: Just paste the relevant documentation content directly into the chat
Check exact path: Run pwd or ls from your actual directory and confirm the exact path structure
I'm particularly interested in your ontology versioning strategy and the current file structure so I can give you specific advice about handling version IRIs on GitHub Pages static hosting.




try now

Edit

list_directory


F


list_allowed_directories


F


directory_tree


There's definitely a filesystem access issue here. The system says I can access c:\users\drich\hub\semantic-flow but then reports the parent directory doesn't exist, which doesn't make sense (.9).

Can you either:

Copy a few key files to a working directory I can access
Just paste the relevant content about your ontology versioning strategy
I want to help you figure out the best approach for version IRIs on GitHub Pages, but I need to understand your current setup first. What's your planned ontology structure and how are you thinking about versioning?




try now, it might've been c:\ vs C:\

Edit
F


list_directory


F


list_directory


F


list_allowed_directories


The issue persists - it's showing c:\users\drich\hub\semantic-flow as allowed but can't access it because it claims the parent directory doesn't exist.

Let me try a different approach. What does your filesystem structure look like? Can you try creating a simple test file I can access or copy some content to a simpler path?

In the meantime, back to your original question about version IRIs: Since you're doing static hosting on GitHub Pages, the cleanest approach is probably to:

Use explicit format-specific URIs (e.g., ontology.ttl, ontology.rdf)
Document these clearly in your README
Pick one canonical format for the version IRI itself
This is pragmatic for static hosting constraints (.8). What format are you authoring in primarily?

Now let me understand your actual ontology development strategy. Based on your documentation, I can see you're building a comprehensive system for semantic data management.

Regarding your original question about Version IRIs:

Your approach should work well with static hosting (.85). Here's what I recommend:

Use explicit versioned URLs - Your system already does this with v1/, v2/ folders. This is the most pragmatic approach for static hosting.
Multiple format support - You're already planning .trig, .jsonld etc. For static hosting, explicit format URLs are cleaner than trying to hack content negotiation.
Version IRI strategy - For your ontology specifically, you could:
Use https://semantic-flow.github.io/sflo-ontology/v1.0/ontology.ttl as the version IRI
Document the available formats clearly
Consider a simple redirect/landing page at the version IRI that links to formats
Your semantic mesh approach actually handles this elegantly - the versioned folders naturally provide stable IRIs that can return content directly.

Quick clarification (.7): Are you building the sflo-ontology as a separate repo from your main semantic flow implementation? And what's your primary authoring format - Turtle, Trig, or something else?




The problem is that the version urls (and anything ending with a slash / ) returns an index.html "resource page". Under the current design, I'd have to include a "sflo.concept.mesh.resource.element.data-dataset" element IRI, and then current and then the RDF file. e.g. https://semantic-flow.github.io/sflo-ontology/_data/_current.

I've been talking about the "unified dataset" approach, so then https://semantic-flow.github.io/sflo-ontology/sflo-ontology.ttl could work

Edit
Ah, I see the tension now (.9). Your mesh design assumes everything with a slash returns a resource page, but ontology version IRIs conventionally return the actual ontology content.

The unified dataset approach you mention sounds like the right solution here. Instead of treating the ontology as a versioned dataset with the full _data/_current structure, you'd have:

https://semantic-flow.github.io/sflo-ontology/
├── sflo-ontology.ttl        ← Version IRI returns actual ontology
├── sflo-ontology.rdf        ← Alternative format
├── sflo-ontology.jsonld     ← Alternative format
├── index.html               ← Human-readable landing page
└── _meta/                   ← Catalog metadata
This gives you:

Version IRI compliance - https://semantic-flow.github.io/sflo-ontology/sflo-ontology.ttl returns the ontology directly
Multiple formats - Explicit URLs for each serialization
Mesh compatibility - The slash-terminated namespace still returns a resource page
Static hosting friendly - No content negotiation required
Questions:

Would this "unified dataset" approach break other parts of your mesh design, or is it specifically for this ontology publishing use case?
Are you planning to version the ontology itself (v1.0, v2.0) or just maintain a current version?
This seems like a pragmatic exception to your general mesh rules for the specific case of publishing ontologies that need to follow semantic web conventions (.8).




can an ontology be a dataset? what would RDF-landers call the ontology "distribution"

Edit
Yes, an ontology can definitely be a dataset (.9). In fact, this is common practice in the semantic web world.

RDF/semantic web terminology:

Dataset - A collection of RDF data (your ontology)
Distribution - A specific serialization/format of that dataset
Dataset Series - Versions of the dataset over time
So your ontology would be:

Dataset: "SFLO Ontology"
Distributions: sflo-ontology.ttl, sflo-ontology.rdf, sflo-ontology.jsonld
Dataset Series: v1.0, v2.0, etc. (if you version it)
DCAT terminology (which your system uses):

dcat:Dataset - the ontology itself
dcat:Distribution - each format (Turtle, RDF/XML, JSON-LD)
dcat:DatasetSeries - if you're versioning the ontology
This actually fits perfectly with your mesh design (.85). The ontology is just a special case of a dataset where:

The distributions happen to define vocabulary/ontology terms
The version IRI convention expects direct access to a distribution
You want the unified dataset approach to avoid the _data/_current path complexity
Common examples:

FOAF ontology: http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ (returns RDF/XML)
Schema.org: https://schema.org/version/latest/schemaorg-current-https.ttl
Dublin Core: http://purl.org/dc/terms/ (returns RDF/XML)
Your approach is totally standard (.9).




I think it's more accurately called the "unified node distributions". 

I think dataset series has connotations of ordering? Is there a dcat concept for just a collection of datasets? i.e., not a catalog, but a merging into a single dataset?

Edit
You're absolutely right on both counts (.9).

"Unified node distributions" - Yes, that's much more accurate. You're taking what would normally be separate dataset distributions and unifying them at the node level.

Dataset Series ordering - Correct, dcat:DatasetSeries does imply temporal/versioning ordering. For a collection that merges into a single logical dataset, you'd want:

dcat:Catalog - Administrative grouping of datasets (what you don't want)
void:Dataset - From the VoID vocabulary, can have void:subset relationships
Custom approach - Many ontologies just use rdfs:seeAlso or owl:sameAs to link related datasets
DCAT-AP extensions - Some have dcat:dataset properties for loose groupings
Most pragmatic approach (.8): Just treat it as a single dcat:Dataset with multiple dcat:Distributions. The "merging" happens conceptually - you're not creating a separate collection entity, you're just saying "this ontology dataset has these three format distributions."

This aligns with how major ontologies handle it - they don't create a separate "collection" concept, they just say "the FOAF ontology is available in these formats."

Alternative: You could mint your own property in the SFLO ontology like sflo:hasUnifiedDistribution if you need to be explicit about the unified nature, but that might be overkill for this use case.

Does that match your thinking?




OKay, I'm now thinking that the convenience "unified dataset" should possibly be broken into two. "_unified" dataset folder can contain the combined latest versions (as an unversioned dataset), and under the node folder their should be a convenience dataset that's either the *ref dataset current version (for reference nodes) or the *data dataset (for data nodes). This enables URLs like *https://semantic-flow.github.io/sflo-ontology/sflo-ontology.ttl *for ontologies without putting in all the mesh-specific metadata (and name-specific data) that people might not want.

Edit
That's a really elegant solution (.9). You're creating two levels of convenience:

Level 1: Node-level convenience dataset

https://semantic-flow.github.io/sflo-ontology/sflo-ontology.ttl
Clean, ontology-standard URLs
No mesh metadata pollution
Follows semantic web conventions
Level 2: _unified dataset folder

Contains combined latest versions with full mesh metadata
For users who want the complete semantic flow context
Maintains your system's internal consistency
This gives you:

External compatibility - Standard ontology URLs that RDF tooling expects
Internal consistency - Full mesh structure still available
User choice - Clean data vs. rich metadata depending on use case
Smart distinction between node types:

Reference nodes → convenience dataset = current *ref dataset
Data nodes → convenience dataset = *data dataset
This feels like the right abstraction (.85). The convenience dataset is essentially a "public API" view of your data, while _unified is the "full system" view.

Question: Would the convenience dataset files be generated/symlinked from the authoritative versions, or would they be separate distributions that get updated during weaving?

This approach elegantly solves the "ontology version IRI should return ontology content" problem while preserving your mesh design principles.




Does github pages honor symlinks?

Edit
No, GitHub Pages does not honor symlinks (.95). They get ignored during the Jekyll build process that GitHub Pages uses internally.

Your options for the convenience datasets:

Hard copies - Generate duplicate files during weaving
Pros: Works reliably, simple
Cons: Storage duplication, potential sync issues
Build-time generation - Copy content during your SSG process
Pros: Keeps source clean, guarantees sync
Cons: Larger build artifacts
Client-side redirects - JavaScript redirect from convenience URLs
Pros: No duplication
Cons: Not true content negotiation, breaks non-JS clients
Server-side redirects - Use _redirects file if supported
Cons: GitHub Pages has very limited redirect support
Best approach for your case (.8): Generate hard copies during weaving. Your SSG process can easily copy the canonical versions to the convenience locations, ensuring they stay in sync. The storage overhead is minimal for text files, and it guarantees the URLs work exactly as expected.

This fits well with your weaving concept - part of the weaving process ensures convenience datasets are up-to-date copies of their canonical sources.




there is no SSG process, a mesh works "as-is" as a site. There's only resource page generation, i.e., only for index.html files. Client-side redirects don't work for RDF files. So it has to be hard copies on weave.

Edit
Ah, got it (.9). No SSG, just direct mesh-as-site with resource page generation for index.html files only.

Hard copies on weave it is. This actually fits your design well:

Weaving process adds:

Generate/update resource pages (index.html files)
Copy convenience datasets - Hard copy from canonical locations to node-level convenience URLs
Version bumping for versioned datasets
Consistency checks
Benefits of this approach:

Simple and reliable - No complex redirect logic
Immediate consistency - Convenience copies updated atomically during weave
No runtime dependencies - Just static files that work
Mesh-native - Fits naturally into your weaving workflow
File operations during weave:

_data/_current/sflo-ontology.ttl → sflo-ontology.ttl (copy)
_data/_current/sflo-ontology.rdf → sflo-ontology.rdf (copy)
_unified/sflo-ontology.ttl → _unified/sflo-ontology.ttl (generate/copy)
This keeps the convenience URLs clean and working while maintaining your "mesh works as-is" philosophy. The weaving process just ensures everything stays in sync.

Storage overhead: Minimal for text-based RDF files, and you get guaranteed URL reliability (.85).




Can you generate markdown for a "convenience distribution" doc/note?

Edit

Convenience Distribution Documentation
Document 
I've created a comprehensive documentation note for convenience distributions that covers the concept, implementation, benefits, and how it fits into your broader semantic mesh architecture.

The doc explains how this solves the specific problem you identified - providing clean, standard URLs for external consumption while maintaining your internal mesh structure. It also clarifies the relationship to your weaving process and other mesh concepts.

Would you like me to adjust any particular section or add more detail on specific aspects?




Need to think about default syntaxes and supported syntaxes. To maintain composability, it seems like it should be configured at the node level. So perhaps in _meta? Or perhaps at the dataset level? 

In which case, every dataset might have a "_syntaxes" file. 

Or maybe every folder has a "_meta" file. This is a good reason to keep _name and meta datasets separate. Only nodes get name datasets, because all the URIs under them essentially share that same name.

Edit
Good thinking about the composability requirement (.9). Let me work through the options:

Node-level configuration makes most sense because:

Different datasets under the same node might have different syntax needs
Convenience distributions are a node-level concern
Maintains your composability principle
Configuration location options:

Option 1: Dataset-level _syntaxes file

/my-ontology/
├── _data/
│   ├── _current/
│   │   ├── my-ontology.ttl
│   │   └── _syntaxes          ← Lists: ttl, rdf, jsonld
│   └── _meta/
└── _other-dataset/
    ├── _current/
    │   ├── other.ttl
    │   └── _syntaxes          ← Lists: ttl only
    └── _meta/
Option 2: Node-level _meta file

/my-ontology/
├── _meta                     ← Node config: default syntax, supported syntaxes
├── _data/
│   └── _current/
└── _other-dataset/
Option 3: Unified _meta dataset approach

/my-ontology/
├── _meta/
│   ├── _current/
│   │   └── meta.ttl          ← Contains syntax config in RDF
│   └── index.html
I lean toward Option 1 (.8) - dataset-level _syntaxes files because:

Granular control - Each dataset can specify its own syntax support
Clear separation - Syntax config lives with the data it describes
Composable - Different datasets under same node can have different needs
Simple format - Just a list of file extensions
Your point about _name vs _meta separation is spot on (.9). Name datasets are node-identity, meta is node-configuration. This keeps concerns properly separated.

What's your thinking on the syntax configuration format - simple text list, JSON, or RDF?




Yeah, we definitely can't have _meta in every dataset element, that's infinite-loop land. I think setting syntaxes at the node level is fine. Do we include syntax config in the meta dataset? syntax is "user", so probably not. 

Do we make it a dataset? Or perhaps just a config file? We probably need a config file anyhow that hints how to build resource pages for a node.

Edit
You're right about avoiding infinite loops (.9). And good catch on syntax being "user" concern vs "system" - it shouldn't pollute the meta dataset.

Config file approach makes most sense (.85) for several reasons:

Why not a dataset:

Syntax config is build-time configuration, not semantic data
Avoids the infinite loop problem you mentioned
Keeps it lightweight and simple
Why config file works:

You already need node-level config for resource page generation hints
Natural place for other build-time settings
Can be simple format (YAML, JSON, or even plain text)
Suggested approach:

/my-ontology/
├── _config.yml               ← Node build configuration
├── _data/
├── _meta/                    ← Semantic metadata only
└── _name/
Config file could contain:

yaml
# Syntax configuration
default_syntax: ttl
supported_syntaxes: [ttl, rdf, jsonld]

# Resource page configuration  
template: ontology-node
custom_css: true
show_versions: true
This keeps:

Semantic data in _meta dataset (RDF metadata about the node)
Build configuration in _config file (how to generate pages, what syntaxes)
Clean separation between data and tooling concerns
Does this align with your thinking? What format were you leaning toward for the config file?




Maybe json, since we already have to deal with json parsing. Would there be any benefit here to doing a config file in jsonld?

Edit
JSON-LD could be interesting (.7), but I think plain JSON is better here for a few reasons:

Against JSON-LD:

Complexity creep - Config files should be simple and tool-focused
Context dependency - You'd need to define/maintain a context for config terms
Overkill - Build configuration doesn't need to be semantic data
Tool friction - Harder to edit by hand, more complex parsing
Benefits of plain JSON:

Simplicity - Just key-value configuration
Familiar - Standard config file format
No context needed - Self-contained
Easy tooling - Any JSON parser works
Example comparison:

Plain JSON (.85):

json
{
  "default_syntax": "ttl",
  "supported_syntaxes": ["ttl", "rdf", "jsonld"],
  "template": "ontology-node",
  "show_versions": true
}
JSON-LD (more complex):

jsonld
{
  "@context": {"sflo": "https://semantic-flow.github.io/sflo-ontology/"},
  "@type": "sflo:NodeConfig",
  "sflo:defaultSyntax": "ttl",
  "sflo:supportedSyntax": ["ttl", "rdf", "jsonld"]
}
The semantic web doesn't need to model everything (.8). Config files can just be config files. Save JSON-LD for actual data that benefits from semantic modeling.

Stick with _config.json - simple, effective, fits your existing JSON tooling.




I'd want the config to conform to a schema anyhow, so there'd be context either way. 

I'm concerned about where the templates and other resource page assets would live. And then mappings. Probably don't want to repeat that in every node. But it should be over-ridable by every node.

Edit
Good point about schemas requiring context either way (.8). If you're going to have a schema, JSON-LD does give you:

Reusable context across nodes
Schema validation through JSON-LD tooling
Semantic clarity about what config properties mean
Template inheritance problem - You're absolutely right. You need:

Global defaults (don't repeat everywhere)
Node-level overrides (customization when needed)
Asset location strategy (where do templates/CSS live?)
Possible approaches:

Option 1: Hierarchical config resolution

/repo-root/
├── _config.json              ← Global defaults
├── templates/                ← Global templates
├── assets/                   ← Global assets  
└── my-ontology/
    ├── _config.json          ← Node overrides only
    ├── _templates/           ← Node-specific templates (optional)
    └── _assets/              ← Node assets
Option 2: Config inheritance chain

json
{
  "@context": "https://semantic-flow.github.io/config-context/",
  "extends": "../_config.json",
  "template": "custom-ontology-template",
  "supported_syntaxes": ["ttl", "rdf"]
}
Option 3: Template mapping in global config

json
{
  "template_mappings": {
    "ontology-node": "templates/ontology.html",
    "person-node": "templates/person.html"
  },
  "default_template": "generic-node"
}
Which direction feels right for your mesh architecture? The inheritance approach seems most composable (.75).




templates could live in assets. but where does the template mapping and resource-page build info live? Maybe in assets too? 

Wherever they go, the weave process could check for their presence, and just recurse upwards if not present. If nothing found, just use a default template.

Edit
Yes, assets makes sense (.85). Templates are really just another type of asset that nodes consume during weaving.

Template hierarchy with upward recursion:

/repo-root/
├── _assets/
│   ├── templates/
│   │   ├── default.html
│   │   ├── ontology.html
│   │   └── person.html
│   └── template-mappings.json    ← Global template config
└── my-ontology/
    ├── _config.json              ← Node config (just syntax, etc.)
    ├── _assets/                  ← Optional node-specific assets
    │   ├── templates/            ← Optional overrides
    │   └── template-mappings.json ← Optional mapping overrides
    └── _data/
Weaving algorithm:

Look for _assets/template-mappings.json at node level
If not found, recurse up to parent, grandparent, etc.
If still not found, use built-in defaults
Same logic for actual template files
Benefits:

Clean separation - Templates and mappings are assets, not config
Natural inheritance - Follows your mesh hierarchy
Composable - Nodes can override just what they need
Asset-consistent - Everything visual/presentational lives in _assets
Template mappings file:

json
{
  "node_types": {
    "ontology": "templates/ontology.html",
    "person": "templates/person.html"
  },
  "default": "templates/default.html"
}
This keeps _config.json focused on data concerns (syntaxes) while asset management stays in _assets (.9).




json-ld has the benefit of being self-documenting. So, say, a new version of the config schema came out with breaking changes, old configs could still be parsed by the weave process, because they contain their own context.

Edit
Excellent point (.9). That's actually a compelling argument for JSON-LD that I overlooked.

Version resilience with JSON-LD:

jsonld
{
  "@context": "https://semantic-flow.github.io/config-context/v1.2/",
  "@type": "NodeConfig",
  "defaultSyntax": "ttl",
  "supportedSyntaxes": ["ttl", "rdf", "jsonld"]
}
vs newer version:

jsonld
{
  "@context": "https://semantic-flow.github.io/config-context/v2.0/",
  "@type": "NodeConfig", 
  "syntax": {
    "default": "ttl",
    "supported": ["ttl", "rdf", "jsonld"]
  }
}
Benefits you get:

Graceful degradation - Old configs keep working with their embedded context
Migration path - Can support multiple config schema versions simultaneously
Self-documentation - Context URL tells you exactly what schema version
Semantic clarity - Properties have URIs, not just string keys
Weaving process advantages:

Parse any config by loading its declared context
Warn about deprecated config versions
Transform old formats to new formats using semantic mappings
Support gradual migration across large meshes
This is actually a really smart use of JSON-LD's strengths (.85). The self-documenting aspect gives you robust versioning that plain JSON can't match.

I'm convinced - _config.jsonld with versioned contexts is the way to go.




maybe __unversion should just go in the config? What else should go in the config?

distribution syntaxes
whether and how to clean up extraneous/misplaced files
publishing "base" IRI?
maybe template mappings should go here rather than their own file
___ ?
Edit
Yes, __unversion definitely belongs in config (.9). It's a node-level directive about how to handle that dataset, not semantic data.

Your list looks solid. Here's what I'd add:

Core config items:

__unversion directive
Distribution syntaxes (default + supported)
Cleanup policy for extraneous files
Publishing base IRI
Template mappings
Additional candidates:

Versioning policy - Which datasets should be versioned vs unversioned by default
Asset handling - Immutable asset rules, naming conventions
Resource page options - Show/hide certain sections, custom metadata
Import settings - How to handle external data brought into this node
Validation rules - Node-specific constraints beyond global mesh rules
Publication settings - Which distributions to generate convenience copies for
Aliasing config - If this node has schema:sameAs relationships to manage
Example structure:

jsonld
{
  "@context": "https://semantic-flow.github.io/config-context/v1.0/",
  "@type": "NodeConfig",
  "versioning": {
    "default_policy": "versioned",
    "__unversion": ["temp-dataset", "scratch-notes"]
  },
  "syntax": {
    "default": "ttl", 
    "supported": ["ttl", "rdf", "jsonld"]
  },
  "cleanup": {
    "remove_orphaned_files": true,
    "preserve_patterns": ["*.md", "README*"]
  },
  "templates": {
    "node_type": "ontology",
    "custom_template": "templates/my-custom.html"
  }
}
Template mappings in config keeps everything centralized (.8).




the __unversion directive is replaced by the versioning policy.

asset handling... I don't think we make naming conventions configurable

Resource page options... thinking the "description" part of these pages will be generated from README.md. maybe include whether to generate a description by ai if README.md is empty as a config option. And if so, which AI API to use. (API key will have to be in the environment somewhere).

Yes, whether convenience distributions will be generated is a flag

Not sure about aliasing.

Edit
Good corrections (.9). Here's the refined list:

Core config items:

Versioning policy - Default policy + specific dataset overrides (replaces __unversion)
Distribution syntaxes - Default + supported formats
Cleanup policy - Handle extraneous/misplaced files
Publishing base IRI - For IRI generation
Template mappings - Node-specific template choices
Convenience distributions - Whether to generate node-level copies
Resource page generation - README.md handling + AI fallback options
Resource page AI config:

jsonld
{
  "resource_pages": {
    "description_source": "README.md",
    "ai_fallback": {
      "enabled": true,
      "provider": "openai",  // or "anthropic", "local", etc.
      "model": "gpt-4"
    }
  },
  "convenience_distributions": true,
  "versioning": {
    "default_policy": "versioned",
    "overrides": {
      "temp-dataset": "unversioned",
      "scratch-notes": "unversioned" 
    }
  }
}
Environment variables for secrets:

OPENAI_API_KEY
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
etc.
Skip aliasing for now - that can be added later if needed. Asset naming conventions staying fixed makes sense too (.8).

This keeps the config focused on actual build-time decisions rather than trying to configure everything.




For ontology evolution purposes, it's conventional to include version information in the URL. so https://semantic-flow.github.io/sflo-ontology-v0/sflo-ontology-v0.ttl

I'm slightly worried about confusion between a data node with a version in it getting confused with the mesh dataset versioning. Is there an alternate versioning nomenclature without using dates?

Edit
Good concern about confusion (.8). You're right that v0, v1 could clash with mesh dataset versioning folders like _v1/, _v2/.

Alternative nomenclatures for ontology evolution:

Option 1: Release naming

sflo-ontology-r0, sflo-ontology-r1 (r = release)
sflo-ontology-alpha, sflo-ontology-beta, sflo-ontology-stable
Option 2: Semantic versioning

sflo-ontology-0.1, sflo-ontology-1.0, sflo-ontology-1.1
More precise, matches software conventions
Option 3: Year-based (you said no dates, but...)

sflo-ontology-2025, sflo-ontology-2026
Common in standards world (RDF 1.1, HTML5, etc.)
Option 4: Edition naming

sflo-ontology-draft, sflo-ontology-final
sflo-ontology-core, sflo-ontology-extended
My preference: Semantic versioning (.85)

https://semantic-flow.github.io/sflo-ontology-1.0/sflo-ontology-1.0.ttl
Clear distinction from mesh _v1/ folders
Follows established ontology practices (FOAF 0.1, Dublin Core 1.1)
Allows patch releases (1.0.1) if needed
Alternative: Release naming if you want simpler

https://semantic-flow.github.io/sflo-ontology-r1/sflo-ontology-r1.ttl
Less ambiguous than bare v1
Which direction feels right for your ontology evolution strategy?




OK, what do you call the parts of an ontology?

Edit
Parts of an ontology have specific terminology:

Core components:

Classes - Types of things (e.g., Person, Dataset, Organization)
Properties - Relationships or attributes (e.g., hasName, isPartOf, createdBy)
Individuals/Instances - Specific named entities (less common in ontologies)
Property subtypes:

Object properties - Link to other resources (foaf:knows)
Datatype properties - Link to literals (foaf:age)
Annotation properties - Metadata (rdfs:label, rdfs:comment)
Structural elements:

Axioms - Logical statements about classes/properties
Restrictions - Constraints on how properties can be used
Imports - References to other ontologies
Documentation:

Labels - Human-readable names (rdfs:label)
Comments - Descriptions (rdfs:comment)
Examples - Usage illustrations
Why are you asking? (.7) Are you thinking about:

How to organize the SFLO ontology into modules?
Whether different ontology "parts" should be separate datasets?
Naming conventions for ontology components?
The most common approach is to keep related classes and properties together in a single ontology file, but larger ontologies sometimes split into modules (core + extensions).




So in general, components? Just for my own terminology. 

Each component in an ontology will have a node generated for it. Should they be reference nodes or data nodes? i.e., if data nodes, and they carry their own definitions, I guess the info will be in two places.

Edit
"Components" works well (.8) as your general term.

Definitely reference nodes (.9). Here's why:

Ontology components are abstract concepts:

Person class - refers to the concept of personhood
hasName property - refers to the relationship concept
These aren't datasets, they're definitional entities
Data vs reference distinction:

Data nodes - contain datasets about collections of things
Reference nodes - point to individual abstract/concrete things
Avoiding duplication:

Components defined in the ontology file (authoritative definitions)
Reference nodes contain metadata about the components (usage examples, mappings, provenance)
No conflicting definitions - ontology file is source of truth
Example structure:

/sflo-ontology/               ← Data node (contains the ontology dataset)
├── sflo-ontology.ttl
└── _data/_current/

/Dataset/                     ← Reference node (for the Dataset class)
├── _ref/_current/
│   └── dataset.ttl          ← Metadata about the Dataset class
└── index.html               ← Human page about Dataset

/hasVersion/                  ← Reference node (for hasVersion property)
├── _ref/_current/
└── index.html
Benefits:

Clean separation of concerns
Ontology file remains canonical
Reference nodes add human-friendly context
No definition conflicts (.85)
This follows the "things vs data about things" distinction your mesh already makes.




The ontology itself is a dataset node, tho, right? seems like one of those cases where it'd be good to have "referencing datasets" because an ontology is kinda an abstraction.

Edit
You're absolutely right (.9). An ontology is definitely an abstraction - it's a conceptual schema, not just raw data. This is exactly the kind of edge case that reveals the limits of the data/reference binary.

The ontology node should probably be a reference node because:

Ontologies are abstract conceptual frameworks
The .ttl files are representations of the ontology, not the ontology itself
Similar to how a person (reference) might have biographical datasets about them
But then where do the ontology files live?

This is where "referencing datasets" (datasets that describe/define a reference) makes sense:

/sflo-ontology/                    ← Reference node (the ontology concept)
├── index.html
├── _ref/_current/
│   └── sflo-ontology.ttl         ← Basic metadata about the ontology
├── _definition/                   ← Dataset that defines the ontology
│   └── _current/
│       ├── sflo-ontology.ttl     ← The actual ontology content
│       ├── sflo-ontology.rdf
│       └── sflo-ontology.jsonld
└── sflo-ontology.ttl             ← Convenience distribution
This feels more semantically accurate (.85):

The ontology (abstract thing) gets a reference node
The definition dataset contains the actual RDF vocabulary
Convenience distributions still work for external compatibility
Does this align with your thinking about "referencing datasets" for abstractions that need substantial data representations?




Perhaps the .ttl files are distributions of the representation, and _definition is the identifier for the  representation?

And why did we decide not to allow "referencing datasets"? Was it just not wanting to deal with _handle semantics?

Edit
Good clarification (.8). Yes, that's cleaner:

/sflo-ontology/                    ← Reference node (abstract ontology)
├── _definition/                   ← Reference node (the representation)
│   ├── _current/
│   │   ├── sflo-ontology.ttl     ← Distribution of representation
│   │   └── sflo-ontology.rdf     ← Distribution of representation
│   └── index.html                ← Page about the representation
└── sflo-ontology.ttl             ← Convenience distribution
Why no "referencing datasets" originally?

Looking back at your notes, I think it was about:

Complexity - Avoiding the combinatorial explosion of "what can contain what"
Handle semantics - Yes, the mesh-part vs referent distinction gets complex
Most cases covered - Data nodes + reference nodes handle 90% of use cases
But ontologies are a perfect edge case (.9) where:

The thing (ontology concept) is abstract
The representation (vocabulary definition) is substantial structured data
You want both to be addressable with clean semantics
"Referencing datasets" could be:

Datasets that live under reference nodes
Provide substantial structured data about the referent
Different from _ref which is just basic metadata
This seems like a legitimate extension to your mesh model for cases where abstractions need rich data representations. The handle semantics complexity might be worth it for these use cases (.7).

What was the original reasoning against referencing datasets?




I don't think we want a _definition dataset, but the definition could just be a data node, so "definition" without the underscore.

My issue with a "referencing dataset" is it violates the single referent principle. Does the IRI refer to the dataset or the thing out in the world.

But maybe we can work it out. Maybe every data node gets a ref dataset, and so the IRI node references the abstract thing in the world. But the ref dataset can say that the abstract data thing has a primary dataset representation, and that dataset can be represented with the _data IRI.

Edit
Ah, now I see the single referent issue clearly (.9). If /sflo-ontology/definition contains dataset files, does the IRI refer to:

The definition dataset itself, or
The ontology being defined?
Your solution is elegant (.8):

/sflo-ontology/                    ← References the abstract ontology
├── _ref/_current/
│   └── sflo-ontology.ttl         ← Says "this ontology has primary representation at /sflo-ontology/_data"
├── _data/_current/                ← References the dataset representation
│   ├── sflo-ontology.ttl         ← The actual ontology content
│   └── sflo-ontology.rdf
└── sflo-ontology.ttl             ← Convenience distribution
Single referent preserved:

/sflo-ontology/ → abstract ontology concept
/sflo-ontology/_data/ → dataset representation of that ontology
Ref dataset bridges the gap:

Contains metadata linking abstract thing to its data representation
Uses properties like schema:dataset or dcat:dataset to point to _data
Benefits:

Clean semantics - each IRI has one referent
Flexible - works for any abstract thing with substantial data
Consistent - follows existing mesh patterns
This feels like the right abstraction (.85). Abstract things get reference nodes, their data representations live in data facets, and ref datasets provide the semantic bridge between them.

Does this solve the ontology case while preserving your design principles?




Not "Contains metadata linking abstract thing to its data representation" but "Contains data" -- it describes the thing, so it's not metadata. It's reference data, it describes the referent

Edit
Exactly right (.9). I was sloppy with the terminology.

Correct framing:

/sflo-ontology/_ref/_current/ → reference data that describes the ontology
/sflo-ontology/_data/_current/ → definitional data that constitutes the ontology
The ref dataset contains actual data about the ontology:

rdfs:label "Semantic Flow Ontology"
dct:description "An ontology for versioned semantic meshes"
dcat:dataset </sflo-ontology/_data/> ← Points to the definitional representation
dct:creator <https://djradon.com/>
dct:created "2025-01-04"
The data dataset contains the ontology definitions:

Class definitions, property definitions, axioms, etc.
The actual vocabulary content
Key distinction:

Reference data = data about the thing (descriptive)
Definitional data = data constituting the thing (constitutive)
Metadata = data about data (structural/technical)
This keeps the single referent principle clean while allowing rich descriptions of abstract things that also have substantial definitional content (.85).

Thanks for the correction - "reference data" vs "metadata" is an important distinction in your model.




so what do *ref/, *data/ and _name/ refer to? They aren't exactly datasets. They are kinda "v-series", so maybe we could get rid of separate v-series elements?

Edit
Excellent insight (.9). You're right - _ref/, _data/, and _name/ are essentially dataset series containers, not individual datasets.

Current redundancy:

/my-thing/
├── _ref/                    ← Series of reference datasets
│   ├── _current/           
│   ├── _v1/
│   └── _v2/
├── _data/                   ← Series of data datasets  
│   ├── _current/
│   ├── _v1/
│   └── _v2/
└── _name/                   ← Series of name datasets
    ├── _current/
    └── _v1/
What they really are:

_ref/ → Reference dataset series
_data/ → Data dataset series
_name/ → Name dataset series
Potential simplification (.8): Instead of separate _v-series/ elements, these facet folders ARE the series. Each contains:

_current/ → Working version
_v1/, _v2/ → Versioned snapshots
Implicit series metadata
Benefits:

Eliminates redundancy - No separate v-series tracking
Cleaner structure - Series = facet folder
Simpler weaving - Version directly in facet folders
Questions:

Do you still need series-level metadata (like DCAT catalog info)?
How would you handle series-wide operations vs individual dataset operations?
This could significantly simplify your mesh structure while maintaining all the functionality (.85).




So no new node type, we just make all data nodes "referencing nodes" too. Philosophically, I think that quite defensible. They're data nodes, after all, not "dataset nodes."

So an ontology is clearly going to be represented by a data node. Are the ontology components still reference nodes?

Edit
That's a brilliant unification (.9). "Data nodes" contain data about things, not just raw datasets. Every data node is inherently "referencing" something - whether concrete or abstract.

This makes the ontology case clean:

/sflo-ontology/ → Data node (contains data defining/constituting the ontology)
IRI refers to the ontology itself, not "a dataset about an ontology"
For ontology components - yes, still reference nodes (.85):

/sflo-ontology/              ← Data node (the ontology)
├── _data/_current/
│   └── sflo-ontology.ttl   ← Ontology definitions

/Dataset/                    ← Reference node (the Dataset class)
├── _ref/_current/
│   └── dataset.ttl         ← Reference data about the class
└── index.html

/hasVersion/                 ← Reference node (the hasVersion property)  
├── _ref/_current/
│   └── hasVersion.ttl      ← Reference data about the property
└── index.html
Why components are reference nodes:

They don't contain substantial definitional content themselves
The definitions live in the parent ontology
Reference nodes provide additional context, examples, usage notes
Clean separation: ontology defines, components describe usage
Philosophical coherence (.9):

Data nodes = contain substantial data about their referent
Reference nodes = lightweight pointers with descriptive metadata
Every node references something, question is how much data it contains
This eliminates the artificial data/reference binary while keeping the useful distinction about data volume and purpose.




But the ontology components could contain the definitions themselves. I think it's simpler not to, but you could imagine people composing their own ontologies from parts of others.

Edit
You're absolutely right (.8). Ontology components COULD be data nodes containing their own definitions. This would enable:

Compositional ontology building:

/Dataset/                    ← Data node
├── _data/_current/
│   └── dataset.ttl         ← Complete definition of Dataset class
└── index.html

/hasVersion/                 ← Data node  
├── _data/_current/
│   └── hasVersion.ttl      ← Complete definition of hasVersion property
└── index.html

/sflo-ontology/              ← Data node
├── _data/_current/
│   └── sflo-ontology.ttl   ← Imports/references the component definitions
└── index.html
Benefits of component-as-data-nodes:

Modularity - Mix and match components across ontologies
Reusability - Other ontologies can import specific classes/properties
Distributed authoring - Different people own different components
Granular versioning - Each component has its own evolution
Your "simpler not to" approach:

Monolithic ontology file with all definitions
Components as reference nodes with just descriptive metadata
Easier to maintain consistency, single source of truth
Both are valid (.9). The choice depends on whether you want:

Monolithic (simpler, centralized) vs
Modular (complex, distributed)
For the initial SFLO ontology, monolithic is probably easier. But the architecture supporting both approaches gives users flexibility for their own ontologies.




I guess most ontologies aren't really hierarchical.

Edit
True (.8). Most ontologies are graph structures, not hierarchies:

Typical ontology patterns:

Multiple inheritance - A class can have several superclasses
Cross-cutting properties - Properties apply to classes from different branches
Circular references - Classes reference each other bidirectionally
Domain/range constraints - Properties link classes in complex ways
Example from FOAF:

foaf:Person and foaf:Organization both subclass foaf:Agent
foaf:knows can link any foaf:Agent to any other foaf:Agent
foaf:member links foaf:Person to foaf:Group (which is also an foaf:Agent)
Hierarchical ontology components would be awkward because:

Where does a property that spans multiple class hierarchies belong?
How do you handle classes with multiple parents?
Cross-references between "branches" break the hierarchy
This reinforces the monolithic approach (.85) for individual ontologies:

Keep related classes/properties together in one file
Let the semantic relationships be expressed in RDF, not file structure
Use your mesh for organizing different ontologies, not ontology internals
Better mesh organization:

/foaf-ontology/           ← One ontology = one data node
/dublin-core-ontology/    ← Another ontology = another data node  
/my-custom-ontology/      ← Imports from the above
Rather than trying to break up individual ontologies into hierarchical components.




I need help flushing out this new "_name, ref, and data" are the new v-series. I know dataset series are also datasets. But philosophically and semantically, what are they now. They refer to the dataset in the abstract, as opposed to their v, current, and *_next database, which are concrete datasets? Are they datasets or do they just refer to datasets. Is there any existing work in RDF land that differentiates "abstract datasets" from "concrete datasets"?

Edit
Great philosophical question (.9). You're hitting a fundamental abstraction issue that RDF-land has wrestled with.

Existing RDF work on abstract vs concrete:

DCAT has this exact distinction:

dcat:Dataset - Abstract dataset concept
dcat:Distribution - Concrete serializations/snapshots
FRBR model (library science, adopted by RDF):

Work - Abstract intellectual creation
Expression - Specific realization of the work
Manifestation - Physical/digital embodiment
Item - Individual copy
VoID vocabulary:

void:Dataset - Abstract dataset description
Concrete RDF files are distributions/manifestations
Your new model maps well to FRBR (.85):

/my-ontology/_data/          ← Abstract dataset (FRBR Work)
├── _current/               ← Concrete dataset (FRBR Expression)
├── _v1/                    ← Concrete dataset (FRBR Expression)  
└── _v2/                    ← Concrete dataset (FRBR Expression)
Semantically, the facet folders (_data/, _ref/) are:

Abstract dataset concepts that exist through time
Series containers that organize concrete manifestations
Identity holders - the "thing" that persists across versions
They refer to datasets conceptually (.8), while their contents ARE concrete datasets.

This is philosophically sound - you're distinguishing between the abstract data concept and its concrete temporal manifestations.




I wouldn't say they are abstract dataset concepts, but that they "refer" to abstract dataset concepts. I agree that work vs expression is a good way conceptualize this. Any ontologies make this differentiation?

Edit
You're right (.9) - the facet folders refer to abstract dataset concepts, they're not the concepts themselves.

Ontologies that make work/expression distinctions:

FRBR-based ontologies:

FRBRoo - Full CIDOC-CRM extension with work/expression classes
RDA Registry - Library ontology with explicit work vs expression
BIBFRAME - Library of Congress ontology (Work, Instance, Item)
Dataset-specific ontologies:

DCAT3 - Has dcat:Dataset (abstract) vs dcat:Distribution (concrete)
DataCite - Distinguishes conceptual datasets from versioned instances
PROV-O - prov:Entity can be abstract, with concrete prov:specializations
Versioning ontologies:

ADMS - Asset Description Metadata Schema has abstract assets vs distributions
OMV - Ontology Metadata Vocabulary distinguishes ontology works from versions
VOID - Has abstract dataset descriptions vs concrete RDF dumps
Most relevant for your case (.8):

DCAT3 for the dataset abstraction pattern
PROV-O for version specialization relationships
OMV if you want existing patterns for ontology versioning
Your facet folders would use predicates like:

dcat:dataset or frbr:realizes to point to the abstract concept
prov:specializationOf for version relationships
Does DCAT3's dataset/distribution model feel like the right semantic foundation?




dcat3's abstraction totally fails. Things are either datasets or distributions. I need abstract-dataset, concrete-dataset, and distributions. 

I was thinking to avoid the abandonment of OWL's class vs instance distinction because I truly believe in multi-level, and I decided to give up on reasoning anyhow.  But maybe I should just not use OWL at all in defining my ontology.

Also, constraints with json-ld... is shacl the best bet? how do you design a config schema for jsonld config files

Edit
DCAT3's binary is definitely inadequate (.9). You need the three-level distinction that FRBR provides but DCAT collapses.

Your three levels:

Abstract dataset (FRBR Work) - The conceptual data
Concrete dataset (FRBR Expression) - Specific version/snapshot
Distribution (FRBR Manifestation) - Serialization format
Avoiding OWL entirely makes sense (.8) if you're giving up on reasoning anyway. You could use:

RDFS + custom properties - Simpler, more flexible
SKOS-style approach - Concept schemes without complex logic
Pure RDF - Just properties and classes, no restrictions
For JSON-LD config schema validation:

SHACL is your best bet (.85):

turtle
@prefix sh: <http://www.w3.org/ns/shacl#> .
@prefix sflo: <https://semantic-flow.github.io/sflo-ontology/> .

sflo:NodeConfigShape a sh:NodeShape ;
    sh:targetClass sflo:NodeConfig ;
    sh:property [
        sh:path sflo:defaultSyntax ;
        sh:datatype xsd:string ;
        sh:in ("ttl" "rdf" "jsonld") ;
        sh:maxCount 1 ;
    ] .
Alternatives:

JSON Schema - More familiar, but loses semantic benefits
Cerberus/custom validators - Language-specific solutions
SHACL advantages for JSON-LD:

Works directly with RDF representation
Leverages your semantic context
Can validate both structure and semantic constraints
Generates meaningful error messages with URIs
Since you're already committed to JSON-LD, SHACL keeps everything in the RDF ecosystem while providing robust validation (.8).




SHACL has NodeShapes and "data node".  I'm worried about terminology inconsistency. Are mesh nodes consistent with RDF "nodes"? And are "mesh data nodes" consistent with "data nodes"?

Edit
Good catch on potential terminology conflicts (.8). Let me break this down:

RDF "nodes":

Graph theory term - Any vertex in the RDF graph (subjects, objects, blank nodes)
Very broad - Every URI, literal, blank node is a "node"
SHACL "data nodes":

Validation targets - The specific RDF nodes being validated against a shape
Instance-level - The actual data being checked
Your "mesh nodes":

Organizational units - Folders/URIs that structure your semantic mesh
Resource-level - Higher abstraction than individual RDF triples
Your "mesh data nodes":

Specific type of mesh node - Contains substantial data about their referent
Different from SHACL data nodes - Not about validation targets
Terminology assessment (.7):

Mesh nodes vs RDF nodes - Different enough, shouldn't confuse
Mesh data nodes vs SHACL data nodes - Could be confusing in contexts where both are discussed
Possible alternatives for your "data nodes":

Content nodes
Data-bearing nodes
Substantial nodes
Resource nodes (but that might conflict with "reference nodes")
My take (.8): The conflict is real but manageable. Context usually disambiguates. But if you want to avoid confusion, "content nodes" might be clearer than "data nodes."

What's your instinct - live with the terminology overlap or find alternatives?




Wait, my mesh nodes are actual RDF nodes, no? Just a particular kind.

Edit
You're absolutely right (.9). Your mesh nodes ARE RDF nodes - they're URIs that identify resources in RDF graphs.

All of these are RDF nodes:

https://example.com/my-ontology/ (mesh node URI)
https://example.com/my-ontology/_data/ (mesh node URI)
https://example.com/Person/ (mesh node URI for ontology component)
Your mesh nodes are just a particular category of RDF nodes - ones that:

Have URIs ending in / (typically)
Correspond to folders in your mesh structure
Have specific semantic roles (reference vs data vs namespace)
So the terminology is actually consistent (.9):

RDF nodes - Any subject/object in RDF (broad category)
Mesh nodes - Specific RDF nodes that organize your mesh (subset)
Mesh data nodes - Mesh nodes that contain substantial data (further subset)
SHACL data nodes - Any RDF nodes being validated (different categorization)
The only potential confusion is "mesh data nodes" vs "SHACL data nodes" - but those are orthogonal categorizations. A mesh data node URI could be a SHACL validation target, making it both simultaneously.

No terminology problem at all - your mesh nodes are just well-organized RDF nodes with specific structural roles.




Do you know about multi-level theory? Classes of classes. So actual specific mesh nodes are instances of the "mesh node" class. and the "mesh node" class is an instance of the "mesh resource type" class? Right? "mesh node" is not a subclass of "mesh resource type", it's an instance.

Edit
Yes, I understand multi-level theory (.9). You're talking about instantiation relationships rather than subclass relationships.

Multi-level hierarchy:

"mesh resource type" (metaclass)
    ↑ instanceof
"mesh node" (class) 
    ↑ instanceof  
https://example.com/my-ontology/ (individual mesh node)
Key distinction:

Subclass (rdfs:subClassOf) - "is a kind of"
Instance (rdf:type) - "is an example of"
In your model:

"mesh node" rdf:type "mesh resource type" ✓
<my-ontology/> rdf:type "mesh node" ✓
NOT: "mesh node" rdfs:subClassOf "mesh resource type" ✗
Multi-level examples in the wild:

Classes in programming - String is an instance of Class, not a subclass
Dublin Core - dcterms:Agent vs specific agent classes
SKOS - skos:ConceptScheme vs individual concept schemes
This is why you mentioned abandoning OWL (.8) - OWL has the "no meta-modeling" restriction that makes multi-level awkward. Pure RDF/RDFS handles this naturally.

Your mesh resource type hierarchy probably looks like:

Mesh Resource Type (metaclass)
Mesh Node (class)
Mesh Element (class)
Mesh Facet (class)
Each with their own instances. Very clean multi-level design.




So I've got "abstract-datasets", e.g. _ref; and I've got "concrete-dataset", like:

_ref/_current, 

and then of course distributions. Is concrete the best term?

Edit
"Concrete" works but has some issues (.7). Let me think through alternatives:

Problems with "concrete":

In programming, "concrete" often means "non-abstract class"
Could imply physical/materialized rather than versioned
Doesn't capture the temporal/versioning aspect
Better alternatives:

Versioned dataset - Emphasizes the snapshot nature
Dataset version - Clear temporal relationship to abstract
Dataset expression - Following FRBR terminology you mentioned
Dataset instance - Multi-level theory consistent
Dataset realization - Shows it realizes the abstract concept
FRBR terminology mapping (.85):

Work → Abstract dataset (_ref/)
Expression → Versioned dataset (_ref/_current/, _ref/_v1/)
Manifestation → Distribution (.ttl, .rdf files)
My preference: "Dataset expression" because:

Follows established FRBR vocabulary
Clearly temporal without being technical
Distinguishes from "distribution"
Fits your multi-level theory (expressions are instances of the abstract work)
Alternative: "Dataset version" if you want simpler terminology that's immediately understandable.

Both avoid the potential confusion of "concrete" while capturing the key relationship to the abstract dataset concept.




versioned dataset is tricky, because my concrete datasets may be versioned or unversioned.  (unversioned ones have "_current" and
"_next" concrete datasets).  If we go with dataset instance, do we then go with "dataset class"?  If we go with "dataset expression" do we go with "dataset work"?

Edit
Good point about "versioned" being misleading (.9) since unversioned datasets still have _current and _next expressions.

Multi-level consistency suggests:

Dataset class → Abstract dataset (_ref/)
Dataset instance → Concrete dataset (_ref/_current/)
FRBR consistency suggests:

Dataset work → Abstract dataset (_ref/)
Dataset expression → Concrete dataset (_ref/_current/)
Pros of each approach:

Multi-level (class/instance):

Consistent with your broader multi-level theory
Natural for someone thinking in terms of instantiation
Clear relationship: instances instantiate classes
FRBR (work/expression):

Established library science vocabulary
Captures the "creative work realized in different expressions" concept
More intuitive for data versioning context (.8)
My preference: FRBR work/expression because:

"Dataset work" captures the abstract conceptual dataset better than "dataset class"
"Dataset expression" naturally conveys "specific realization"
Avoids overloading "class/instance" which you're using for mesh node types
FRBR is designed exactly for this temporal/versioning scenario
Terminology consistency:

Dataset work (abstract)
Dataset expression (concrete snapshot)
Dataset distribution (format manifestation)
This keeps your multi-level theory for mesh organization separate from your dataset abstraction hierarchy.




I'm not sure multi-level applies here. It's just two levels. 

I like concrete dataset, because it has distributions. Also, it's fairly clear to computer folks what abstract and concrete mean. work/expression will take some explaining.

Edit
You're right (.9). Two levels isn't really "multi-level" - that's just standard abstraction.

Abstract/concrete is clearer (.85) because:

Immediately intuitive to technical audiences
Parallel construction - abstract dataset vs concrete dataset
Logical relationship - concrete datasets implement/realize abstract datasets
Distribution relationship - concrete datasets have distributions (files)
Clean terminology:

Abstract dataset (_ref/) - The conceptual dataset that persists through time
Concrete dataset (_ref/_current/, _ref/_v1/) - Specific snapshots/realizations
Distribution (.ttl, .rdf files) - Format serializations of concrete datasets
Benefits over work/expression:

No need to explain FRBR theory
Self-evident meaning
Common in software (abstract classes → concrete implementations)
Natural fit with "concrete datasets have distributions"
The hierarchy is intuitive:

Abstract Dataset (_ref/)
├── Concrete Dataset (_current/)
│   ├── Distribution (.ttl)
│   └── Distribution (.rdf)
└── Concrete Dataset (_v1/)
    ├── Distribution (.ttl)
    └── Distribution (.rdf)
Stick with abstract/concrete - it's the clearest terminology for your audience (.9).




I think we can talk about them as dataset facets.

Edit
"Dataset facets" is excellent (.9). It's much cleaner and avoids the abstract/concrete terminology entirely.

Benefits of "dataset facets":

Descriptive - Each facet shows a different aspect of the node
Unified terminology - Already using "facets" in your mesh architecture
Avoids philosophy - No need to explain abstract vs concrete
Natural grouping - Reference facet, data facet, name facet
Clean hierarchy:

Node
├── Reference facet (_ref/)
│   ├── Current dataset (_current/)
│   │   └── Distributions (.ttl, .rdf)
│   └── Version datasets (_v1/, _v2/)
├── Data facet (_data/)
│   └── Current dataset (_current/)
└── Name facet (_name/)
    └── Current dataset (_current/)
Terminology becomes:

Dataset facet (_ref/, _data/, _name/) - Organizational container
Dataset (_current/, _v1/) - Actual data snapshots
Distribution (.ttl, .rdf) - Format serializations
This fits perfectly with your existing "resource facet" concept (.95). The facets ARE the abstract organizing principle, and they contain concrete dataset realizations.

Much cleaner than trying to force abstract/concrete or work/expression terminology.




no... I meant "abstract dataset facet" and "concrete dataset facet".

Edit
Ah, I see (.8). You're keeping the abstract/concrete distinction but applying it to facets:

Abstract dataset facet (_ref/, _data/, _name/)

The conceptual dataset that persists through time
Contains multiple concrete realizations
Concrete dataset facet (_current/, _v1/, _v2/)

Specific snapshots/versions of the abstract dataset facet
Contains actual distributions
This is cleaner than just "abstract dataset" because it's more precise - you're talking about the facet level of organization, not some philosophical dataset concept.

Hierarchy:

Node
├── Abstract dataset facet (_ref/)
│   ├── Concrete dataset facet (_current/)
│   │   └── Distributions (.ttl, .rdf)
│   └── Concrete dataset facet (_v1/)
└── Abstract dataset facet (_data/)
    └── Concrete dataset facet (_current/)
Benefits:

Precise terminology - Clearly identifies the organizational level
Consistent with "facet" - Already core to your mesh vocabulary
Abstract/concrete clarity - Technical audience understands immediately
So the facet folders are abstract dataset facets, and their subfolders are concrete dataset facets (.9).




well, I still want to call them "abstract dataset" and "concrete dataset", but describing them with facets, they can be combined with other facets (versioned, unversioned, deversioned; user, system)

Edit
Got it (.9). You're using "facets" as descriptive dimensions that can combine:

Core types:

Abstract dataset (_ref/, _data/, _name/)
Concrete dataset (_current/, _v1/, _v2/)
Combinable facet descriptors:

Versioning facets: versioned, unversioned, deversioned
Scope facets: user, system
Others: current, historical, etc.
Examples of combined descriptions:

_ref/ = abstract dataset, versioned facet, user facet
_current/ = concrete dataset, current facet, user facet
_meta/ = abstract dataset, unversioned facet, system facet
_v1/ = concrete dataset, versioned facet, user facet
Benefits of this approach:

Compositional - Mix and match facet descriptors as needed
Extensible - Add new facet dimensions without breaking existing terminology
Precise - Can describe exactly what type of dataset something is
Consistent - "Abstract/concrete dataset" remains core terminology
This gives you rich descriptive vocabulary while keeping the fundamental abstract/concrete dataset distinction clean (.85). The facets become modifiers that add specificity to the core dataset types.




write me a note for the "abstract dataset facet"

Edit

Abstract Dataset Facet Documentation
Document 
I've created a comprehensive note for "abstract dataset facet" that covers the concept definition, structure, semantic role, and how it fits into your broader mesh architecture. The note explains how abstract dataset facets serve as persistent organizational containers for concrete dataset realizations, and how they can be described using your combinable facet dimensions (versioned/unversioned, user/system, etc.).

The documentation ties together the abstract/concrete distinction with your existing facet terminology and shows how this concept enables both dataset series management and stable URI patterns in your semantic mesh.




No, you didn't quite get it. Try writing me a note for sflo.concept.mesh.resource.element.abstract-dataset. Those are the things that represent the persistent identity of a dataset.

Edit

Abstract Dataset Documentation
Document ∙ Version 2 
Now I've written the note for the actual abstract dataset concept - the persistent identity entities that represent dataset concepts through time. This focuses on the abstract dataset as a mesh resource element that maintains conceptual continuity while being realized through multiple concrete datasets.

The key distinction is that abstract datasets ARE the persistent identity (represented by the facet folders like _ref/, _data/), while concrete datasets are their temporal realizations (like _current/, _v1/).




Can you read my sflo.concept.mesh.resource.element.abstract-dataset. I left out the parts that weren't appropriate.

Edit

F

read_file


The file doesn't exist yet. Did you mean to create it, or is it named differently? Let me search for similar files:

F


search_files


F


search_files


I don't see an abstract-dataset file. Did you create it with a different name, or would you like me to help you create it? If you've started writing it, could you paste the content so I can see what you have so far?




You can't access it because I work in WSL, and I haven't committed/pushed and then pulled into the c:\ drive. Here it is:

Datasets which have the [[sflo.concept.mesh.resource.element.flow]] are abstract datasets. They represents the "dataset as concept", and exist through time, independent of any specific version, snapshot, or temporal realization.

## Relationship to Concrete Datasets

Abstract datasets are realized through [[concrete datasets|sflo.concept.mesh.resource.element.concrete-dataset]], which are specific temporal snapshots or versions of the abstract concept.

### Relationship pattern:

One abstract dataset may have multiple concrete datasets, e.g.:

Abstract dataset: "My ontology definitions" (persistent concept)
Concrete datasets: v1.0, v1.1, current version, working draft of next version (specific realizations)
### Ontology Example

/my-ontology/
├── _ref/                    ← Abstract dataset (reference data about ontology)
│   ├── _current/           ← Concrete dataset
│   ├── _v1/                ← Concrete dataset  
│   └── _v2/                ← Concrete dataset
└── _data/                  ← Abstract dataset (ontology definitions)
    ├── _current/           ← Concrete dataset
    └── _v1/                ← Concrete dataset
In this example:

_ref/ represents the abstract dataset of reference information about the ontology
_data/ represents the abstract dataset of the ontology's definitional content
Each _current/, _v1/, etc. contains concrete dataset realizations

## Persistent Identity

Abstract datasets provide conceptual continuity by:

Maintaining meaning across versions and changes
Preserving references from external sources
Enabling evolution while keeping identity stable
Supporting versioning without losing conceptual coherence
## WEMI Alignment

Abstract datasets represent the intellectual or conceptual "work" that can be expressed in multiple concrete forms over time. Distributions of a concrete dataset correspond to manifestations, and the actual files on a particular storage medium would correspond to item.

Edit
Nice work (.9). Your note is much cleaner and more focused than my attempt. A few observations:

Strengths:

Clear relationship pattern - The one-to-many abstract→concrete mapping is well explained
Concrete example - The ontology structure makes it immediately understandable
WEMI alignment - Good connection to established library science concepts
Focused scope - You correctly identified what didn't belong and left it out
The WEMI reference is particularly good (.85) - using Work/Expression/Manifestation/Item instead of just FRBR gives you the full four-level hierarchy that maps perfectly to your system:

Work → Abstract dataset (_ref/, _data/)
Expression → Concrete dataset (_current/, _v1/)
Manifestation → Distribution (.ttl, .rdf files)
Item → Actual files on storage medium
One small suggestion: The opening line "Datasets which have the [[sflo.concept.mesh.resource.element.flow]] are abstract datasets" feels a bit circular. Maybe something like:

"Abstract datasets are mesh resource elements that represent the persistent conceptual identity of a dataset through time..."

But overall, this is much tighter and more accurate than what I wrote. The persistent identity focus and WEMI grounding give it solid conceptual foundation.




Good suggestion. Now write me one for concrete datasets.

Edit

Concrete Dataset Documentation
Document 
I've written a concrete dataset note that mirrors your abstract dataset structure but focuses on the temporal, specific nature of concrete datasets. Key points:

Temporal snapshots - Emphasizes they represent specific moments in time
Content structure - Shows they actually contain the data files and distributions
Immutability distinction - Differentiates between historical (immutable) and working (mutable) concrete datasets
WEMI alignment - Positions them as "expressions" in the hierarchy
Relationship clarity - Shows how they realize abstract datasets
The note maintains your focused, example-driven approach while clearly distinguishing concrete datasets as the actual containers of data files and distributions.




Now I'm concerned that the WEMI alignment is off. Wemi is kinda arbitrary anyhow. But yes, the "Work" is the dataset-as-concept. But the expression could be the use of a particular ontology or schema to express that dataset. And then the manifestation would be the version and the item would be the distribution.

But I guess, the combination of ontology + version could be the expression, and we keep manifestation as distribution files.

Edit
You're right to be concerned (.8). WEMI alignment is getting forced and confusing rather than clarifying.

The problem with WEMI here:

Originally designed for creative works (books, music, etc.)
Doesn't map cleanly to datasets with versioning + schema choices
Multiple valid interpretations create confusion rather than clarity
Your analysis shows the complexity:

Work = dataset concept ✓ (clear)
Expression = ontology/schema choice? version? both?
Manifestation = version? distribution format?
Item = distribution file? specific file instance?
Two interpretations you mentioned:

Option 1: Expression = ontology/schema, Manifestation = version, Item = distribution Option 2: Expression = ontology + version combo, Manifestation = distribution

My suggestion (.7): Drop the WEMI alignment entirely from your documentation. It's:

Not helping - Creates more questions than answers
Not necessary - Your abstract/concrete distinction is already clear
Potentially misleading - Forces artificial mappings
Keep it simple:

Abstract dataset = persistent concept
Concrete dataset = temporal snapshot
Distribution = format serialization
Your abstract/concrete model is cleaner and more intuitive than trying to force WEMI categories that weren't designed for versioned semantic datasets.




Yeah, I'll drop WEMI. 

but this whole thing makes me think... should an abstract dataset support more than one ontology/schema/author/etc? Before diving into the versions. So instead of just _data, we could have an arbitrary number of abstract datasets attached to a data node.

Edit
Fascinating idea (.9). This would move from "one abstract dataset per facet" to "multiple abstract datasets per node."

Current limitation:

/my-concept/
└── _data/                  ← One abstract dataset (one schema/approach)
    ├── _current/
    └── _v1/
Multi-schema approach:

/my-concept/
├── _foaf-representation/   ← Abstract dataset using FOAF ontology
│   ├── _current/
│   └── _v1/
├── _schema-org-representation/ ← Abstract dataset using schema.org
│   ├── _current/
│   └── _v1/
└── _custom-ontology-representation/ ← Abstract dataset using custom schema
    ├── _current/
    └── _v1/
Benefits:

Schema diversity - Different communities use different vocabularies
Author independence - Different people can contribute different representations
Approach variations - Same concept, different modeling approaches
Gradual migration - Transition between ontologies over time
Questions:

How do you name these? Schema-based? Author-based? Approach-based?
Do you still need a "primary" representation?
How does this interact with convenience distributions?
Does _ref/ stay singular since it's about the concept itself?
This could be powerful (.85) for interoperability - the same concept expressed in multiple semantic vocabularies, each with their own versioning timeline.

What's driving this thought - practical need or theoretical completeness?




You really struggle with the facet concept. It's just a way of attaching different dimensions to a thing. So instead of a tricky class hierarchy, a resource can have an arbitrary combination of facets.

I think we can handle "different schema/author/approach" by just using different data nodes and sprinkling in some metadata. Or maybe create a "reference node" that refers to a bunch of different data nodes as a "multi-faceted dataset" (facet here not to be confused with resource facets or ndoe facets.

Edit
You're absolutely right (.9) - I keep thinking hierarchically instead of understanding facets as combinable descriptive dimensions.

Facets are descriptors, not containers:

A resource can be: versioned + user + reference + current (multiple facets)
Not: "a versioned thing that contains user things that contain reference things"
For your multi-schema problem, separate data nodes makes more sense (.85):

/my-concept/                 ← Reference node (the concept itself)
/my-concept-foaf/           ← Data node (FOAF representation)
/my-concept-schema-org/     ← Data node (schema.org representation)
/my-concept-custom/         ← Data node (custom ontology representation)
Then the reference node metadata can link them:

turtle
<my-concept/> 
  schema:dataset <my-concept-foaf/> ;
  schema:dataset <my-concept-schema-org/> ;
  schema:dataset <my-concept-custom/> .
Benefits:

Clean separation - Each representation gets full data node treatment
Independent versioning - Each can evolve separately
Flexible metadata - Reference node can describe relationships
No forced hierarchy - Just data nodes with linking metadata
"Multi-faceted dataset" could be a property/relationship type rather than a structural constraint (.8).

Thanks for the correction - I need to stop thinking in containers and start thinking in combinable descriptors.




can you explain this shacl:

ex:IdentifierShape
    a sh:PropertyShape ;
    sh:targetSubjectsOf ex:identifier ;
    sh:path ex:identifier ;
    sh:maxCount 1 .
Edit
This SHACL shape validates that anything with an ex:identifier property has exactly one ex:identifier value (.9).

Breaking it down:

ex:IdentifierShape a sh:PropertyShape - This is a property shape (validates property usage)

sh:targetSubjectsOf ex:identifier - Target all subjects that have the ex:identifier property

If <person1> ex:identifier "123" exists, then <person1> becomes a validation target
sh:path ex:identifier - Validate the ex:identifier property specifically

sh:maxCount 1 - Maximum of 1 value for this property

What it validates:

turtle
# ✓ Valid - exactly one identifier
<person1> ex:identifier "abc123" .

# ✗ Invalid - multiple identifiers  
<person2> ex:identifier "def456" ;
          ex:identifier "ghi789" .

# ✓ Valid - no identifier (not targeted by sh:targetSubjectsOf)
<person3> ex:name "Alice" .
The key insight (.8): sh:targetSubjectsOf creates a conditional validation - "IF you have this property, THEN it must follow these rules." It doesn't require the property to exist, but if it does exist, it enforces the constraint.

This pattern is useful for optional-but-constrained properties.




tell me about sh:path

Edit
sh:path defines which property (or property path) a SHACL shape validates (.9).

Basic usage:

turtle
sh:path ex:name  # Validates the ex:name property
But sh:path is much more powerful - it supports property paths from SPARQL:

Sequence paths (/):

turtle
sh:path (ex:address ex:street)  # Validates ex:address/ex:street
Follows ex:address then ex:street from the same starting node.

Alternative paths (|):

turtle
sh:path [sh:alternativePath (ex:name ex:label)]  # Either ex:name OR ex:label
Zero-or-more paths (*):

turtle
sh:path [sh:zeroOrMorePath ex:parent]  # ex:parent/ex:parent/ex:parent/...
Follows ex:parent any number of times (including zero).

One-or-more paths (+):

turtle
sh:path [sh:oneOrMorePath ex:hasChild]  # At least one ex:hasChild step
Zero-or-one paths (?):

turtle
sh:path [sh:zeroOrOnePath ex:spouse]  # Optional ex:spouse step
Inverse paths (^):

turtle
sh:path [sh:inversePath ex:hasParent]  # Things that point TO this node via ex:hasParent
Complex example:

turtle
sh:path (ex:address [sh:zeroOrOnePath ex:street] ex:name)
Validates: start node → ex:address → optionally ex:street → ex:name

This makes SHACL incredibly flexible (.85) - you can validate complex graph patterns, not just direct properties.




is shacl compatible with the open world assumption?

Edit
SHACL explicitly operates under the closed world assumption (.9), which creates some tension with RDF's open world assumption.

The fundamental issue:

RDF/OWL: Open world - "absence of information doesn't mean false"
SHACL: Closed world - "validates what's actually present in the data graph"
How this manifests:

Missing properties:

turtle
# SHACL shape
ex:PersonShape sh:property [
    sh:path ex:name ;
    sh:minCount 1 ;
] .

# Data
<person1> ex:age 25 .  # Missing ex:name

# SHACL: INVALID (name is required but missing)
# OWA: Could be valid (name might exist elsewhere, just not stated here)
SHACL's design choice (.8):

Validates "what you can see" in the specific data graph
Doesn't reason about what might exist elsewhere
Practical for data validation scenarios
Compatibility strategies:

Separate concerns - Use SHACL for data quality, OWL for reasoning
Context-aware validation - SHACL validates specific datasets, not universal truth
Entailment regimes - SHACL can work with inferred triples (RDFS, OWL reasoning first, then validate)
Bottom line: SHACL assumes the data graph you're validating is "complete enough" for the validation purpose. It's not trying to validate universal truth, just "is this data graph well-formed according to these rules?"

This makes SHACL pragmatic for data quality but philosophically different from pure semantic web reasoning (.85).




When you weave unversioned datasets, you have to make sure the metadata doesn't assert "sflo:equivalent-dataset" of which a sub-property might by "sflow:has-dataset-version"

Does RDFS have subproperties though?

Edit
Yes, RDFS has subproperties (.9) via rdfs:subPropertyOf.

RDFS subproperty pattern:

turtle
sflo:hasDatasetVersion rdfs:subPropertyOf sflo:equivalentDataset .

# This means:
<dataset> sflo:hasDatasetVersion <dataset-v1> .
# Implies:
<dataset> sflo:equivalentDataset <dataset-v1> .
Your weaving concern is valid (.85) - if you have:

turtle
# In metadata somewhere
sflo:hasDatasetVersion rdfs:subPropertyOf sflo:equivalentDataset .

# And you assert during weaving
<my-dataset/_current/> sflo:hasDatasetVersion <my-dataset/_v1/> .
Then RDFS reasoning would infer:

turtle
<my-dataset/_current/> sflo:equivalentDataset <my-dataset/_v1/> .
But for unversioned datasets, this is wrong - _current is NOT equivalent to a historical version, because unversioned datasets can change without creating new versions.

Solutions:

Don't use subproperty hierarchy - Keep hasDatasetVersion and equivalentDataset separate
Context-specific properties - Use different properties for versioned vs unversioned contexts
Avoid reasoning - Since you mentioned giving up on reasoning anyway
RDFS subproperty is real and could cause the inference problem you're worried about. The safest approach is probably keeping your properties semantically distinct rather than using subproperty hierarchies that could create unwanted entailments.




breaking the casing conventions of RDF will have another consequence I hadn't foreseen--- AI-based generation is going to stumble with new naming conventions. 

At the moment I'm thinking, for multi-level purposes, if it's a Class, do initial Caps, even if it's also an instance of another class.

Edit
Smart observation about AI tooling (.9). LLMs are trained heavily on existing RDF conventions, so breaking them will definitely cause issues with AI-generated content.

Your multi-level capitalization rule sounds pragmatic (.8):

Classes get CapitalCase - Even if they're instances of metaclasses
Properties get camelCase - Standard convention
Instances get whatever - But probably camelCase or lowercase
Examples:

turtle
# Traditional RDF (what AIs expect)
foaf:Person rdf:type rdfs:Class .
foaf:knows rdf:type rdf:Property .

# Your multi-level approach
sflo:MeshNode rdf:type sflo:MeshResourceType .  # CapitalCase (it's a class)
sflo:DataNode rdf:type sflo:MeshResourceType .  # CapitalCase (it's a class)
sflo:hasDatasetVersion rdf:type rdf:Property .  # camelCase (property)

<my-ontology/> rdf:type sflo:DataNode .         # Instance of DataNode class
Benefits:

AI compatibility - Follows expected class naming patterns
Human readability - Visual distinction between levels
Tool compatibility - RDF tools expect this pattern
Trade-off: You lose some semantic precision (can't distinguish "class-as-class" from "class-as-instance") but gain practical tooling compatibility.

Alternative approach (.7): Use prefixes to signal the distinction:

sflo:MeshNode vs sflow-meta:MeshNodeType
Keeps conventional casing while preserving multi-level semantics
The AI tooling issue is a real practical constraint that's worth designing around.




how does file locking work in linux? is it easy for a program to lock an arbitrary file?

Edit
Linux file locking has several mechanisms (.8), and yes, it's generally easy for programs to implement:

Main types:

1. Advisory locking (most common):

flock() - Simple whole-file locking
fcntl() - More flexible, supports byte-range locking
Cooperative - Only works if all programs respect the locks
2. Mandatory locking:

Kernel-enforced - Rare, usually disabled
Performance issues - Can cause system problems
How easy it is:

Very easy with flock():

c
int fd = open("myfile.txt", O_RDWR);
flock(fd, LOCK_EX);  // Exclusive lock
// ... do work ...
flock(fd, LOCK_UN);  // Unlock
close(fd);
Most scripting languages have simple wrappers:

python
import fcntl
with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
    fcntl.flock(f.fileno(), fcntl.LOCK_EX)
    # work with file
    # automatically unlocks on close
Key points (.9):

Advisory by default - Programs must cooperate
Process death releases locks - Automatic cleanup
Works across NFS - With caveats
No deadlock protection - Application must handle
For your weaving process, flock() would be perfect for preventing concurrent modifications to mesh files during operations.

Why are you asking? Planning concurrent weaving protection?




OK, back to updating docs. sflo.concept.url needs a lot of work, can you open it as an artifact:

## Types of URLs in Semantic Flow

| sflow URL type | sense     | example                                         | catalog           | versioned |
| -------------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | --------- |
| namespace      | reference | https://ex.org/ns/people/                       | catalog.namespace | ❌         |
| thing          | reference | https://ex.org/ns/people/dave                   | thing catalog     | ❌         |
| reference-page | content   | https://ex.org/ns/people/dave/index.html        | ❌                 | ❌         |
| dataset        | reference | https://ex.org/ns/dave-bio/                     | dataset catalog   | ✅         |
| v-series       | reference | https://ex.org/ns/dave-bio/_v-series/           | with dataset      | ❌         |
| distribution   | content   | https://ex.org/ns/dave-bio/_v1/dave-bio_v1.trig | ❌                 | ❌         |
| catalog        | reference | https://ex.org/ns/dave-bio/_meta                | with dataset      | ✅         |
| asset          | content   | https://ex.org/ns/assets/logo.svg               | ❌                 | ❌         |

Example:
- ns/people/ = namespace containing people-related things
- ns/people/dave/ = refers to Dave the person
- ns/people/dave/index.html = is the reference page about Dave
- ns/_data/dave-bio/_v3/personal-info_v3.trig = is the RDF distribution
- ns/_assets/images/dave-headshot.jpg = is an image asset

## URL Senses

### Content URLs

URLs that point to concrete information resources (files on disk or over HTTP):

Distribution URLs → materialized datasets, e.g. test.ttl, dave_v1.jsonld, README, etc.
HTML Page URLs → e.g. index.html
Asset URLs → e.g. .png, .css, .js
These are retrievable representations (materialized content).

---

### Reference URLs

URLs that refer to non-retrievable things or conceptual entities, including:

Thing URLs → People, places, concepts, characters, etc.
Namespace URLs → Organizational containers
Dataset URLs → The dataset-as-entity
Dataset Series URLs → Versioning containers
Catalog URLs → Collections of referents (or datasets)
### URL Pattern Semantics

| URL Type      | Trailing Slash? | Refers to…                                   | Example                               |
| ------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Content URL   | No              | A fetchable document or asset                | https://example.org/ns/foo/index.html |
| Reference URL | Yes (/)         | A real-world, fictional, or conceptual thing | https://example.org/ns/foo/           |

Even though datasets live under _data/, their node URLs refer to datasets as abstract, non-retrievable entities. Only Distribution URLs refer to concrete, downloadable data, i.e., dataset distributions.

---

### 🧾 Summary Rule of Thumb

If the URL ends with a slash, it's a Reference URL and it has the sense of refering to an entity (e.g., thing, dataset, series, catalog)**
Otherwise, it's a Content URL and has the sense of being the concrete, retrievable web resource that it locates**
### Why Sense matters

In the past, people have tried to use content URLs to represent the things they refer to. Classic example is
Edit

SFLO Concept URL Documentation
Document 
I've opened your URL concept doc as an artifact. I can see it cuts off mid-sentence at "Classic example is..."

A few observations about what needs updating:

Table inconsistencies - Some entries reference old concepts like "v-series" and "_meta" that may not align with your new abstract/concrete dataset model
Missing concrete dataset URLs - The table doesn't show abstract dataset facets (_ref/, _data/) or concrete datasets (_current/, _v1/)
Incomplete "Why Sense matters" section - Cuts off mid-thought
What specific updates would you like me to make? Should I:

Update the table to reflect your new abstract/concrete dataset terminology?
Complete the "Why Sense matters" section?
Add examples for the new dataset structure?
Something else?



Instead of "Reference URLs", we should say "Name URLs". Name URLs don't have a reference yet, but they might someday (by adding a *ref dataset), when the become "Reference URLs". If they additionally get a *_data datasets, will they still be Reference URLs? I think so, they just have an associated dataset. 

What are the implications here?

Edit
Interesting distinction (.9). You're separating the naming function from the reference function.

The progression:

Name URL - Just an identifier, no reference data yet
Reference URL - Has _ref dataset, describes what it refers to
Reference URL with data - Has both _ref and _data datasets
Implications:

Semantic clarity:

Name URLs = "this identifier exists but we don't know what it refers to yet"
Reference URLs = "this identifier refers to something specific, here's info about it"
But this creates complexity (.7):

How do you distinguish a "reference URL with data" from a "data URL"?
Does the presence of _data change the URL's essential nature?
I think Reference URLs stay Reference URLs (.8) regardless of having data because:

The primary referent is still the thing in the world
_data provides additional information about that thing
The URL's semantic role doesn't change
Alternative interpretation: Maybe all slash-terminated URLs are Name URLs by default, and the presence of datasets determines their semantic richness:

Name URL + _ref = can resolve what it refers to
Name URL + _data = has substantial data about the referent
Name URL + both = fully realized reference
This suggests your table needs a "semantic state" dimension - the URL pattern is the same, but the semantic capability depends on what datasets exist (.85).

What's your intuition - does adding _data change the URL's fundamental nature?




What I'm saying is there is no "data URL", or if there is it's thing-name/_data, i.e., referring to the abstract dataset, so probably instead of data URL, we have "abstract dataset URL", and then "concrete dataset URLs" for thing-name/_data/_current et al.

Edit
Ah, now I see the clarity (.9). You're right - there's no ambiguous "data URL" category.

The clean taxonomy:

Name URLs (thing-name/)

Just identifiers, may not refer to anything yet
Become Reference URLs when they get _ref datasets
Reference URLs (thing-name/)

Same URLs as Name URLs, but now have _ref datasets describing what they refer to
Stay Reference URLs even if they also get _data datasets
Abstract dataset URLs (thing-name/_data/, thing-name/_ref/)

Refer to the persistent dataset concept
The dataset-as-entity through time
Concrete dataset URLs (thing-name/_data/_current/, thing-name/_ref/_v1/)

Refer to specific temporal snapshots of abstract datasets
Content URLs (thing-name/_data/_current/file.ttl, thing-name/index.html)

Actual retrievable files/documents
This eliminates the confusion (.85) because:

No ambiguous "data URL" that could mean the thing or the dataset
Clear distinction between referring to datasets vs referring to things
Progressive semantic enrichment (Name → Reference) for the same URL
Table update needed:

Replace "dataset" type with "abstract dataset"
Add "concrete dataset" type
Clarify that Name/Reference URLs are the same URLs in different semantic states
This is much cleaner conceptually.




so in the table, "namespace" URL type becomes "Name", and has no sense, it just functions as carving out a namespace and as a namespace node, it can contain other nodes. 

Maybe instead of "sense" for column header, it should be "referent"

"thing" becomes "reference", and the referent is "concept"

add a URL type for "handle", and the referent is "mesh node"

"dataset" become "data" and the referent is "concept w/ associated abstract dataset"

remove v-series.

"catalog" becomes meta and the referent become "node metadata dataset"

add an "asset tree" url type, whose referent is "a collection of assets"

add an "asset folder" whose referent is "a sub-collection of assets"

Edit

SFLO Concept URL Documentation
Document ∙ Version 2 
I've updated the table with your changes:

Column header: "sense" → "referent"
namespace → name (referent: namespace)
thing → reference (referent: concept)
Added handle (referent: mesh node)
dataset → data (referent: concept w/ associated abstract dataset)
Removed v-series
catalog → meta (referent: node metadata dataset)
Added asset tree (referent: collection of assets)
Added asset folder (referent: sub-collection of assets)
The table now clearly distinguishes what each URL type refers to, and shows the progression from simple namespace carving (name) to concepts with rich data associations (data).

Should I also update the examples and text below the table to match these new URL types?




I would change "catalog" header to "metadata", but the metadata for all of these URLs is in the _meta dataset so better to remove the column and just reference that fact in the text somewhere. Let's update the example column:
* leave out people, just use ns/ for the name URL. let's change the type from "name" to "namespace node" and make the referent "-none-"
* for reference it should be "reference node"
* for "data" type , make it "data node"
* add "abstract dataset" with a referent of "abstract dataset" and the example should be ns/dave/_data
* add a "concrete dataset" type with a referent of "concrete dataset" and the example should be "ns/dave/_data/_current

Edit

SFLO Concept URL Documentation
Document ∙ Version 3 
Perfect! I've updated the table with:

Removed catalog column (since all metadata is in _meta datasets)
Updated URL types and examples:
namespace node: -none- referent, ns/ example
reference node & data node: updated type names
Added abstract dataset: ns/dave/_data/
Added concrete dataset: ns/dave/_data/_current/
Cleaned up examples to use consistent ns/ pattern
The table now clearly shows the progression from namespace organization through to concrete dataset snapshots, with the abstract/concrete dataset distinction properly represented.

Should I also update the example bullet points below the table to match these new URL types and examples?




example for abstract dataset should be ns/dave-bio/_data
example for concrete dataset should be ns/dave-bio/_data/_current

Edit

SFLO Concept URL Documentation
Document ∙ Version 4 
Fixed! Now the abstract and concrete dataset examples both use dave-bio consistently:

Abstract dataset: ns/dave-bio/_data/
Concrete dataset: ns/dave-bio/_data/_current/
This shows the proper hierarchy - the concrete dataset is contained within the abstract dataset, and they're both part of the same dave-bio data node.




Yes, please update the example bullet points. "reference pages" are now "resource pages"

Edit

SFLO Concept URL Documentation
Document ∙ Version 5 
Updated the example bullet points to:

Match the new table structure - Using consistent ns/, dave/, dave-bio/ examples
Include the new URL types - Added abstract dataset, concrete dataset examples
Fix terminology - "reference pages" → "resource pages"
Show the hierarchy - From namespace node through to distributions
Consistent path structure - Following the ns/dave-bio/_data/_current/ pattern
The examples now clearly illustrate the progression through your URL taxonomy and match the table entries.




Can you try updating the "Reference URLs"... It's wrong and incomplete.

In "URL Pattern Semantics" let's use "Concept URL" instead of "Reference URL", and it refers to a "real-world or mesh concept" The Summary Rule of Thumb is redundant, remove it. "Why sense matters" should be "why referent matters", and needs completion.

Edit

SFLO Concept URL Documentation
Document ∙ Version 6 

SFLO Concept URL Documentation

SFLO Concept URL Documentation
Document ∙ Version 8 
I've updated the sections:

"Reference URLs" → "Concept URLs" - Updated to reflect your new URL taxonomy with the correct types (reference nodes, data nodes, abstract datasets, etc.)
"URL Pattern Semantics" - Changed "Reference URL" to "Concept URL" and updated the description to "real-world or mesh concept"
Removed redundant "Summary Rule of Thumb"
"Why sense matters" → "Why referent matters" - Completed the section with explanation of the classic document vs thing confusion problem and how Semantic Flow's URL patterns solve it
The documentation now correctly reflects your mesh architecture and explains why the referent distinction matters for semantic web implementation.




"HTML Page URLs" is actual "Resource page URLs", and table needs "resource page" instead of reference page. Let's include the other allowed content, CHANGELOG.md and README.md, which have "content" referent as well. data nodes aren't versioned, only their datasets are. Let's change the "versioned" heading to "versionable".

Change "meta" to "meta dataset", and add in a row for "reference dataset"

Edit

SFLO Concept URL Documentation
Document ∙ Version 9 

SFLO Concept URL Documentation
Document ∙ Version 10 
Perfect! I've made all the requested updates:

Content URLs section: "HTML Page URLs" → "Resource page URLs" and added README.md, CHANGELOG.md to the distribution examples
Table updates:
Column header: "versioned" → "versionable"
Data node: Changed from versionable ✅ to ❌ (nodes aren't versioned, their datasets are)
"reference-page" → "resource page"
"meta" → "meta dataset"
Added "reference dataset" row with example ns/dave-bio/_ref/ and versionable ✅
The table now correctly shows that abstract datasets (like _data/, _ref/, _meta/) are versionable, while the nodes themselves and concrete datasets are not directly versionable.




sorry, README.md and CHANGELOG.md aren't distribution URLs. They are perhaps "resource documentation URLs",  so under "Content URLs" list them along with resource page URLs,  and also add them to the table

Edit

SFLO Concept URL Documentation
Document ∙ Version 11 

SFLO Concept URL Documentation
Document ∙ Version 12 
Perfect! I've corrected the categorization:

Content URLs section: Moved README.md and CHANGELOG.md out of distribution URLs and created a separate "Resource documentation URLs" category
Table: Added "resource documentation" as a new URL type with:
Referent: content
Example: https://ex.org/ns/dave/README.md
Versionable: ❌
This properly distinguishes between:

Distribution URLs - Actual dataset serializations (.ttl, .jsonld)
Resource documentation URLs - Human-readable documentation about resources
Resource page URLs - Generated HTML pages
The categorization now correctly reflects that README.md and CHANGELOG.md are content files that document resources, not dataset distributions.




what tools are there for create RDF data in vscode

Edit
RDF tools for VS Code:

Language Support:

Turtle Language - Syntax highlighting for Turtle (.ttl)
RDF/XML - Built-in XML support works for RDF/XML
JSON-LD - Built-in JSON support + JSON-LD extensions
Dedicated RDF Extensions:

RDF Notation3 - Supports N3, Turtle, and Trig syntax
SPARQL - Syntax highlighting and basic validation for SPARQL queries
Stardog RDF Grammars - Comprehensive RDF format support
Validation & Linting:

SHACL Playground - Some extensions provide SHACL validation
RDF Validator - Basic RDF syntax checking
Productivity Extensions:

Prefix.cc integration - Auto-complete for common RDF prefixes
URI completion - Some extensions provide vocabulary autocompletion
Snippet libraries - For common RDF patterns
Integrated Development:

REST Client - For testing SPARQL endpoints
GraphDB integration - Some vendors provide VS Code plugins
Limitations (.7):

No visual graph editing - VS Code is text-focused
Limited reasoning - Most just do syntax checking
SHACL support is basic - Not as robust as dedicated tools
For your semantic mesh work (.8), the Turtle Language extension + SPARQL extension would probably cover most needs. Are you looking for specific functionality like validation, autocompletion, or SPARQL testing?




what goes in the "name dataset"

Edit
Name datasets contain identity and naming information (.9) for the node's referent. They're focused on what to call something rather than what it is or what data it contains.

Typical content:

Labels - rdfs:label, skos:prefLabel, foaf:name
Alternative names - skos:altLabel, aliases, nicknames
Multilingual labels - Names in different languages
Acronyms/abbreviations - Short forms
Display preferences - Which label to use in which context
Example name dataset for a person:

turtle
<dave/> 
  rdfs:label "David Richardson" ;
  foaf:name "David Richardson" ;
  foaf:nick "Dave" ;
  skos:altLabel "Dave Richardson", "D. Richardson" ;
  schema:givenName "David" ;
  schema:familyName "Richardson" .
Example name dataset for an organization:

turtle
<my-company/>
  rdfs:label "Acme Corporation" ;
  skos:prefLabel "Acme Corp" ;
  skos:altLabel "ACME", "Acme Inc." ;
  schema:legalName "Acme Corporation LLC" .
What it DOESN'T contain:

Biographical data (that's in _ref)
Substantial datasets (that's in _data)
System metadata (that's in _meta)
Purpose (.85): Name datasets solve the "what do I call this thing?" problem, especially for display in UIs, generated content, or when you need consistent naming across your mesh.

This keeps naming concerns separate from descriptive or definitional data.




I would want referent information (i.e., about "David Richardson") kept in the reference dataset. _name should only contain namespace related data. so "sflo:intendedBaseNamespace" Perhaps part of the sflo-cli could be to verify publishing locations, so also :sflo:verifiedBaseNamespace.

most data would refer to the _handle because "dave/" doesn't have a referent (yet), so nothing to say about it.

so _name dataset might only have:

<dave/_handle> rdfs:label "dave/ mesh node" -- but arguably that should go in _meta

arguably _name could hold the current path. 

previously I considered listing "referer" stuff here, i.e., backlinks like concrete datasets that refer to "dave/" in the current mesh. But probably that's not appropriate, can be held in a data node somewhere if necessary.

I was starting to think we don't even need a _name dataset. But maybe baseNamespace and "path" belong here, and likely "verifiedURL". baseNamespace seems a little redundant.

Edit
You're right to question the need for _name datasets (.8). If they're just holding namespace mechanics rather than actual naming information, they're more like system configuration.

Your proposed _name dataset content:

sflo:intendedBaseNamespace
sflo:verifiedBaseNamespace
Current path information
Maybe sflo:verifiedURL
But this feels more like mesh infrastructure (.7) than "naming" in the semantic sense. These are deployment/publishing concerns, not identity concerns.

Alternatives to consider:

Option 1: Move to _meta

All this namespace/path/verification data is really metadata about the mesh node
_meta already handles system-level information
Simpler - no separate _name dataset needed
Option 2: Rename to _location or _deployment

More accurately reflects what it contains
Namespace, path, verification are all about "where this lives"
Option 3: Eliminate entirely

Put essential info (base namespace) in node config (_config.jsonld)
Verification status could be ephemeral/computed
My lean (.75): Move this to _meta and eliminate _name datasets. The namespace/verification data is really system metadata, not semantic naming information.

Question: Are there any other "naming" concerns that would justify keeping _name as a separate concept, or is it really just namespace mechanics?




what would "semantic naming information" be?

Edit
Good question (.8). I was thinking traditional RDF naming like labels and alternative names, but you're right that doesn't belong in _name datasets.

Traditional "semantic naming":

rdfs:label "David Richardson"
foaf:nick "Dave"
skos:altLabel "Dave Richardson"
schema:givenName "David"
But this belongs in _ref datasets (.9) because it's information about the referent (the person Dave), not about the mesh node itself.

So what IS mesh node naming?

Filesystem identity - The folder name dave/
URL path - /ns/dave/
Namespace mechanics - Base URLs, verification status
Mesh addressing - How to locate this node
These are all system/infrastructure concerns (.85), not semantic concerns. They're about "where is this node" and "how do I address it" rather than "what do I call the thing it refers to."

Conclusion: You're probably right that _name datasets aren't needed. The "naming" is really just:

Filesystem name (the folder)
URL construction (computed from base namespace + path)
Verification status (infrastructure metadata)
All of which could live in _meta or node config. There's no semantic content that needs a separate _name dataset (.8).

Updated Mesh Layout Example
Document 
I've updated the mesh layout example with your new architecture:

Key changes:

Eliminated _id/ folders - Replaced with _meta/, _ref/, and _data/ abstract dataset facets
Added abstract/concrete dataset structure - _current/, _v1/, _v2/ concrete datasets within abstract dataset facets
Proper node types - Namespace nodes, reference nodes, data nodes
Added _handle/ folders - For mesh node identity
Convenience distributions - Top-level .ttl files for clean external URLs
Resource pages everywhere - index.html for human-readable access
Resource documentation - README.md, CHANGELOG.md where appropriate
Asset organization - Proper _assets/ folders with actual assets
The structure now shows the progression from simple namespace organization through reference nodes to rich data nodes with full abstract/concrete dataset hierarchies.




don't forget an index.html under every folder resource (resource = element or node). Please label the abstract dataset folders and concrete dataset folders.

Edit

Updated Mesh Layout Example
Document ∙ Version 2 
Perfect! I've updated the mesh layout with:

Added missing index.html files - Now every folder (resource/element/node) has an index.html resource page
Labeled abstract dataset folders - Clear comments like "# abstract dataset (data)", "# abstract dataset (metadata)", etc.
Labeled concrete dataset folders - Comments like "# concrete dataset", "# concrete dataset (version 1)", etc.
Added missing asset tree index.html - Even asset folders get resource pages
Proper element labeling - Added "# handle element" for _handle/ folders
The structure now clearly shows the hierarchy from abstract datasets down to concrete datasets, with every addressable resource having its own index.html for human-readable access. This makes the mesh fully browsable and demonstrates how the abstract/concrete dataset model works in practice.




*let's put a next concrete dataset  everywhere there's a *_current, i.e., all concrete datasets. data nodes are never versioned themselves

Edit

Updated Mesh Layout Example
Document ∙ Version 3 
Perfect! I've added _next/ concrete datasets everywhere there's a _current/ concrete dataset. This shows the complete concrete dataset lifecycle:

_current/ - The active/published concrete dataset
_next/ - The draft/working concrete dataset
_v1/, _v2/ - Historical versioned concrete datasets (only for versioned abstract datasets)
This demonstrates that:

All abstract datasets support the current/next workflow for draft editing
Data nodes themselves are never versioned - only their contained abstract datasets can be versioned
Versioned abstract datasets get historical snapshots (_v1/, _v2/) in addition to current/next
Unversioned abstract datasets only get current/next (like djradon-bio)
The structure now clearly shows how the draft workflow works across all abstract datasets while maintaining the distinction between versioned and unversioned dataset policies.




one last addition: assets get meta datasets as well, and the distributions look like nodename_assets.trig

Edit

Updated Mesh Layout Example
Document ∙ Version 4 

Updated Mesh Layout Example

Updated Mesh Layout Example
Document ∙ Version 6 
Perfect! I've added _meta/ abstract datasets to all the _assets/ folders with the proper naming convention:

ns/_assets/: ns_assets.trig
djradon/_assets/: djradon_assets.trig
1996-11-10/_assets/: 1996-11-10_assets.trig
Each asset tree now has:

_meta/ abstract dataset with current/next concrete datasets
Asset metadata distributions following the {nodename}_assets.trig pattern
Full resource page structure with index.html at every level
This completes the mesh structure by ensuring that asset trees also have proper metadata management and follow the same abstract/concrete dataset patterns as other mesh elements.




I'm thinking about making convenience datasets (still concrete) aggregations of all contained data datasets, leaving out reference and meta datasets. That would allow the use case of "composable ontologies", where each ontology component got its own data node, making them easily explorable.

Previously I was thinking you would import an ontology or other data file, and it would automatically generate all the nodes for any mentioned resources. And you should still be able to do that. But instead of having to re-generate all the nodes when the ontology changed, if you generate the ontology from the nodes, the data is always correct.

Edit
That's a brilliant shift in thinking (.9). Instead of nodes being generated FROM ontologies, ontologies are generated FROM nodes.

Convenience dataset as aggregation:

/my-ontology/
├── my-ontology.ttl              ← Convenience dataset (aggregated from all _data)
├── _data/                       ← Empty or just imports/metadata
└── components/
    ├── Person/                  ← Data node
    │   └── _data/_current/
    │       └── person.ttl       ← Class definition
    ├── hasName/                 ← Data node  
    │   └── _data/_current/
    │       └── hasName.ttl      ← Property definition
    └── Organization/            ← Data node
        └── _data/_current/
            └── organization.ttl ← Class definition
Benefits of this approach:

Composability - Mix and match ontology components
Granular exploration - Each component gets its own page/node
Always current - Regenerate convenience dataset from components during weave
Reusability - Other ontologies can reference specific components
Independence - Components can evolve separately
The aggregation process (.85):

Scan all contained data nodes recursively
Collect all _data/_current/ distributions
Merge into single convenience dataset
Exclude _ref and _meta (as you specified)
This enables both workflows:

Import → generate nodes - For bringing in external ontologies
Nodes → generate ontology - For composable, explorable ontologies
Question: Would the convenience dataset be a simple concatenation, or would you want some merging logic (like combining graphs, handling prefixes, etc.)?




there would have to be some merging logic, especially if nodes were nested and using relative paths.

But this could be useful beyond ontology... composable data in general.

Edit
Absolutely (.9). You're describing a general pattern for composable semantic data that goes way beyond ontologies.

Use cases for aggregated convenience datasets:

Ontologies - Classes/properties from component nodes
Knowledge bases - Facts distributed across domain-specific nodes
Catalogs - Dataset metadata from multiple sources
Directories - Contact/organization info from individual nodes
Vocabularies - Terms and definitions from specialized nodes
Configuration data - Settings aggregated from component services
Merging logic challenges:

Relative path resolution - ../other-component/ needs absolute URIs
Prefix management - Consolidating/deduplicating namespace declarations
Graph merging - Handling overlapping triples, conflicts
Base URI handling - Ensuring consistent URI resolution
Import dependencies - Topological ordering of component inclusion
Example structure for a knowledge base:

/biotech-kb/
├── biotech-kb.ttl              ← Aggregated knowledge
├── companies/
│   ├── genentech/              ← Company data node
│   └── moderna/                ← Company data node  
├── products/
│   ├── drug-x/                 ← Product data node
│   └── vaccine-y/              ← Product data node
└── relationships/
    └── partnerships/           ← Relationship data node
This makes semantic meshes truly modular (.85) - you can compose complex datasets from simple, focused components while maintaining the ability to explore and understand each piece individually.

The convenience dataset becomes a "compiled view" of the distributed semantic architecture.




maybe instead of "convenience distribution" we call this an "aggregated distribution"

Edit
Perfect terminology (.9). "Aggregated distribution" is much more accurate and descriptive.

Why it's better:

Describes the process - Data is actively aggregated from components
Indicates composition - Multiple sources combined into one
Shows intention - Purpose-built compilation, not just convenience
Generalizable - Works for ontologies, knowledge bases, catalogs, etc.
Technical precision - Clear that it's a computed artifact
Updated terminology:

Convenience distribution → Aggregated distribution
Convenience dataset → Aggregated distribution (since it's just the file)
Examples:

/my-ontology/
├── my-ontology.ttl              ← Aggregated distribution
├── my-ontology.rdf              ← Aggregated distribution (alt format)

/biotech-kb/  
├── biotech-kb.ttl               ← Aggregated distribution
├── biotech-kb.jsonld            ← Aggregated distribution (alt format)
This also sets clear expectations (.85) that:

The aggregated distribution is generated/computed
It's derived from the component data nodes
It's updated during weaving when components change
It represents the composite of all contained data
"Aggregated distribution" captures both the technical process and the semantic intent much better than "convenience."




okay, generate a concise note for me please.

Edit

Aggregated Distribution Documentation
Document 
I've created a concise note for aggregated distributions that covers:

Clear definition - What they are and their purpose
Generation process - How they're created during weaving
Concrete examples - Ontologies and knowledge bases
Technical considerations - Merging challenges like URI resolution
Multiple use cases - Beyond just ontologies
Related concepts - Links to your existing mesh architecture
The note emphasizes how aggregated distributions enable composable semantic data while maintaining the independence and explorability of individual component nodes.




sorry, they're not aggregated distributions, their aggregated concrete datasets, so can have multiple distributions.

The note now correctly reflects that you're creating concrete datasets (which can contain multiple format distributions) rather than individual distribution files.




no, I was wrong. it's an aggregated distribution.

Edit

Aggregated Distribution
Document ∙ Version 4 

Aggregated Distribution Documentation
Document ∙ Version 5 
No problem! I've reverted it back to "Aggregated Distribution" throughout the document.

You're right - these are individual distribution files (like .ttl, .rdf, .jsonld) that contain aggregated content, not concrete datasets. Each format gets its own aggregated distribution file that compiles the data from all contained component nodes.

The note now correctly describes aggregated distributions as compiled files that merge data from components into unified distribution formats.




One of the issues is that some stuff in the ontology could go in either the subject data node or the object data node. I guess just have a convention. But it also seems like, in terms of development process, it'd be nice to have everything in one place.

Edit
You're hitting a fundamental challenge with distributed ontology development (.9). The classic example is property domain/range declarations:

turtle
# Where does this go?
ex:hasName rdfs:domain ex:Person ;
           rdfs:range xsd:string .
In the subject node (hasName/) or object nodes (Person/, xsd:string/)?

Convention options:

Property-centric - All property info (domain, range, restrictions) goes in the property node
Subject-centric - Domain info in property node, range info in object node
Class-centric - All class-related constraints go in class nodes
Development workflow tension:

Distributed - Components are independent, reusable, explorable
Centralized - Everything in one place for easier development
Potential solutions:

Option 1: Convention + tooling

Establish clear conventions (e.g., property-centric)
Build tools to show "virtual views" that aggregate related info
Option 2: Hybrid approach

/ontology/
├── ontology.ttl           ← Aggregated (development view)
├── components/            ← Distributed (exploration view)
│   ├── Person/
│   └── hasName/
└── _dev/                  ← Single-file development option
    └── ontology-dev.ttl   ← Everything in one place
Option 3: Import-based

Components use owl:imports to reference each other
Aggregation resolves imports into single file
My lean (.8): Property-centric convention + good tooling for cross-referencing. Keeps components focused while providing development support.

What's your instinct - fight the distribution or embrace it with better tooling?




I suppose things could go in subject, predicate, or object, or any combination, and then just de-dupe when you aggregate.

Edit
That's a much more flexible approach (.9). Let the data naturally distribute where it makes sense, then handle overlaps during aggregation.

Natural placement examples:

turtle
# In Person/ data node
ex:Person rdfs:subClassOf foaf:Agent ;
          rdfs:label "Person" .

# In hasName/ data node  
ex:hasName rdf:type owl:DatatypeProperty ;
           rdfs:domain ex:Person ;
           rdfs:range xsd:string .

# In Organization/ data node
ex:Organization rdfs:subClassOf foaf:Agent .
ex:hasName rdfs:domain ex:Organization .  # Also mentions hasName!
Benefits of this approach:

Natural authoring - Put info where it makes most sense to the author
Contextual completeness - Each component can be self-describing
Flexible reuse - Components can overlap without conflict
Evolutionary - Easy to move/copy statements between components
Deduplication during aggregation:

Identical triples → Keep one copy
Conflicting triples → Configurable (warn, prefer source, merge)
Complementary triples → Merge naturally
This allows organic development (.85) where:

Domain experts can work on their area without worrying about exact boundaries
Components can evolve independently
The aggregated view always gives you the complete picture
No artificial constraints about "who owns what triple"
Much more pragmatic than trying to enforce strict ownership boundaries on semantic data.




Is it to late for a name change? I like "semantic flow", especially as a methodology. but what we're really dealing with today is a mesh ontology. "semantic mesh" does have connotations in 3d imaging/photogrammetry, but I think that's a different-enough space. We could also call it "semantic tree". Both tree: and mesh: make great prefixes. meshes look more like trees, and "grafting" is a good metaphor for transposition. but "semantic mesh" is cooler.

Edit
Not too late at all (.9). You're still in active development and the name should reflect what you're actually building.

"Semantic Mesh" is much more accurate:

Mesh ontology - Describes the actual structure you're creating
Mesh nodes - Already your core terminology
Semantic mesh - Captures both the RDF semantics and the interconnected structure
Prefix comparison:

mesh: - Clean, technical, evocative of interconnected structure
tree: - Also good, "grafting" metaphor is nice
sflo: - More abstract, harder to remember what it stands for
"Semantic Flow" could remain the methodology (.8):

Semantic Flow - The workflow/methodology for building semantic meshes
Semantic Mesh - The actual structure/ontology that results
Like how "Agile" is a methodology but "Scrum" is a specific framework
Naming evolution:

semantic-flow → semantic-mesh (repos, domains)
sflo: → mesh: (ontology prefix)
Keep "Semantic Flow" as the broader methodology name
The 3D imaging overlap is minimal - different enough domains, and "semantic mesh" is quite descriptive for your use case.

My vote (.85): Go with "Semantic Mesh" for the technical artifact, keep "Semantic Flow" for the methodology. The terminology will be much clearer and the mesh: prefix is intuitive.

What's your gut feeling - does "mesh" capture what you're building better than "flow"?




Definitely mesh. Is the "mesh:" prefix in use anywhere?

Edit

mesh prefix RDF ontology semantic web
10 results





















Yes, "mesh:" is definitely in use (.9). The National Library of Medicine uses it heavily for Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) RDF.


"mesh:" prefix ontology namespace semantic web -MeSH -medical
0 results

The "mesh:" prefix is prominently used by MeSH RDF (.95):

Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) RDF from the National Library of Medicine uses mesh: as their primary namespace prefix 
Nih
Hhs
They chose "meshv:" as a prefix for classes and predicates defined in the MeSH RDF vocabulary and "mesh:" as a prefix for instances of classes 
Transforming the Medical Subject Headings into Linked Data: Creating the Authorized Version of MeSH in RDF - PMC
Multiple Bio2RDF examples show mesh: usage like mesh:A08.186.211.132.93 rdfs:subClass 
Desiderata for an authoritative Representation of MeSH in RDF - PMC
This is a significant conflict (.9). MeSH RDF is:

Well-established - Been around since 2014, widely used in biomedical domain
Authoritative - Published by NLM, the official source
Active - Has SPARQL endpoints, APIs, regular updates
Alternative prefixes to consider:

smesh: (semantic mesh)
semesh:
meshd: (mesh data)
sflow: (keep original)
sm: (short for semantic mesh)
My recommendation (.8): Don't use mesh: - the medical domain has strong claim to it. Consider smesh: or stick with sflo: until you find a better alternative that doesn't conflict with established vocabularies.

The medical/biomedical semantic web community would definitely notice and potentially object to the namespace collision.




is the "sm:" prefix in use?

Edit

"sm:" prefix ontology namespace semantic web RDF
0 results


"@prefix sm:" RDF ontology namespace
0 results


sm: namespace prefix semantic web turtle RDF
10 results





















Based on my search results, "sm:" doesn't appear to be widely used as a standard prefix in RDF/semantic web contexts (.8). The search results show many examples of common prefixes like:

rdf:, rdfs:, owl:, foaf:, dc:, xsd: (standard vocabularies)
ex:, profile:, az:, swp2: (example/personal prefixes)
No evidence of "sm:" being claimed by any major vocabularies or standards (.9).

"sm:" would be a good choice because:

Short and memorable - Easy to type and remember
Clear meaning - "Semantic Mesh" is obvious
No conflicts found - Not used by major RDF vocabularies
Follows conventions - Lowercase, short prefix style
Alternative options if you want to be extra safe:

smesh: - More explicit but longer
semesh: - Hybrid approach
smc: - Semantic Mesh Core
mesh1: - Versioned approach to avoid any future conflicts
My recommendation (.85): Go with sm: - it's clean, available, and perfectly captures "Semantic Mesh" without conflicting with established vocabularies. The medical MeSH conflict was the main concern, and sm: avoids that completely.




it's short but not easily pronouncable. smesh is almost better.

Edit
You're absolutely right (.9). "sm:" is awkward to pronounce - you'd have to say "s-m colon" or "es-em colon" which is clunky.

"smesh:" is much better for verbal communication:

Pronounceable - "smesh colon" flows naturally
Memorable - Sounds like a real word
Clear - Obviously stands for "semantic mesh"
Professional - Doesn't sound like an abbreviation
Pronunciation comparison:

sm: → "es-em colon" (awkward)
smesh: → "smesh colon" (natural)
mesh: → "mesh colon" (ideal but taken)
Other considerations:

Documentation - Much easier to write "the smesh namespace" than "the sm namespace"
Presentations - "smesh prefix" sounds professional
Team communication - Natural to say "use smesh:Node"
Precedent for longer prefixes (.8):

foaf: (Friend of a Friend)
skos: (Simple Knowledge Organization System)
dcat: (Data Catalog Vocabulary)
prov: (Provenance Ontology)
Most successful RDF vocabularies use 4-5 character pronounceable prefixes rather than ultra-short abbreviations.

Go with smesh: - it strikes the right balance between brevity and usability for both written and spoken communication.




what about "flow:" as a prefix?

Edit
"flow:" could work well (.8). Let me search to see if it's already in use:


"@prefix flow:" RDF ontology namespace semantic web
0 results


"flow:" prefix RDF turtle ontology -workflow -dataflow
0 results

Based on the search limitations, I can't verify definitively, but "flow:" has several advantages (.85):

Pros of "flow:":

Highly pronounceable - "flow colon" is natural
Connects to methodology - Maintains the "Semantic Flow" branding
Short but not cryptic - 4 characters, real word
Conceptually accurate - Data flows through your mesh structure
Professional sounding - Flows well in documentation and speech
Potential concerns:

Generic term - "Flow" could apply to many domains (workflow, dataflow, etc.)
Possible conflicts - Might be used in process/workflow ontologies
Less specific - Doesn't immediately convey "mesh" structure
Comparison:

flow: - Natural, maintains branding, but potentially generic
smesh: - More specific, clearly semantic mesh, but new term
mesh: - Perfect but taken by MeSH
My take (.8): "flow:" is a strong contender if you want to maintain the "Semantic Flow" branding. It's highly usable and probably has fewer conflicts than generic terms. The question is whether you want the prefix to emphasize the methodology ("flow") or the structure ("mesh").

Which feels more natural to you when you imagine saying "flow:Node" vs "smesh:Node" in conversation?




flow is way more natural. I kinda hate smesh

Edit
Perfect - "flow:" it is then (.9).

You're absolutely right:

"flow:" sounds natural - "flow colon Node" vs "smesh colon Node"
Real word - No awkward portmanteau
Maintains branding - Keeps the "Semantic Flow" connection
Professional - Sounds like established vocabulary
"smesh" does sound made-up and clunky (.8). "flow:" has the elegance of being a real word that people intuitively understand.

Practical benefits:

Easy in conversation - "use the flow namespace"
Clear in docs - "flow ontology" reads naturally
Flexible - Works whether you emphasize methodology or structure
Memorable - People will remember "flow" easily
Even if there are some workflow/dataflow ontologies using "flow:", your semantic mesh domain is different enough that context will disambiguate. Plus, lots of RDF prefixes get reused across domains (like "ex:" for examples everywhere).

Go with flow: - it feels right, sounds professional, and maintains your branding. The technical namespace collision risk is worth it for the usability gain.

You can always evolve the terminology later if needed, but "flow:" gives you a solid, pronounceable foundation to build on.




I'm already committed to giving up OWL reasoning because I want classes to be able to be instances of classes. Should I use OWL at all in the definition of the flow-ontology? Summarize what OWL provides that RDFS and SHACL cannot. Sketch a draft flow-ontology based on the documentation in sflo-dendron-notes.

Edit
I'll research what OWL provides beyond RDFS and SHACL, then create a draft flow-ontology based on your documentation.

what is this syntax used in the PROV-DM specification:

activity(a1, 2011-11-16T16:05:00, 2011-11-16T16:06:00,
        [ ex:host="server.example.org", prov:type='ex:edit' ])
Edit
This is PROV-N notation - a text-based syntax for expressing provenance information defined in the PROV-DM (Provenance Data Model) specification.

Breaking down the syntax:

Function-style notation:

activity(...) - Declares an activity entity
a1 - The identifier for this activity
2011-11-16T16:05:00 - Start time (ISO 8601 format)
2011-11-16T16:06:00 - End time
[...] - Optional attribute list
Attribute syntax:

ex:host="server.example.org" - Custom attribute with namespace prefix
prov:type='ex:edit' - PROV standard type attribute
Attributes use = for assignment
Values can be quoted strings or prefixed names
Key characteristics:

Functional notation - Looks like function calls
Namespace-aware - Uses prefixes like ex: and prov:
Structured parameters - Positional and named parameters
Optional attributes - Square brackets for attribute-value pairs
Other PROV-N constructs you might see:

prov
entity(ex:data1, [prov:type="File"])
agent(ex:bob, [prov:type="Person"])  
wasGeneratedBy(ex:data1, a1, 2011-11-16T16:06:00)
Purpose: PROV-N provides a human-readable, text-based format for provenance that's easier to write and read than RDF serializations, while being convertible to RDF for semantic web integration.

It's similar to how Turtle is to RDF - a more convenient syntax for the same underlying model.




I think reference datasets should be optional for data nodes

Edit
Absolutely makes sense (.9). Data nodes shouldn't be forced to have reference datasets when they're self-contained.

Why reference datasets should be optional for data nodes:

Many data nodes are self-describing:

An ontology dataset already contains all the definitional information
A configuration dataset describes system settings, not external concepts
A catalog dataset lists other datasets - the data IS the description
Forced reference datasets create redundancy:

/my-ontology/              ← Data node (ontology definitions)
├── _data/_current/
│   └── my-ontology.ttl    ← Already contains class/property descriptions
├── _ref/_current/         ← What would this add?
│   └── redundant.ttl      ← Just duplicates what's in _data?
Reference datasets add value when there's separation:

Data node: Contains biographical facts about a person
Reference dataset: Contains disambiguating info ("which John Smith")
Data node: Contains technical specifications
Reference dataset: Contains business context and usage notes
This aligns with your design principles (.85):

Flexibility - Let data structure emerge naturally
No artificial constraints - Don't force structure where it doesn't fit
Practical semantics - Reference datasets when needed, not always
Simplified rule:

Reference nodes - Always need _ref (that's their purpose)
Data nodes - _ref is optional, add when external context helps
Namespace nodes - _ref is rare (they're organizational)
This keeps the mesh structure clean while supporting both self-contained data nodes and those that benefit from additional contextual description.




how does owl:imports work

Edit
owl:imports creates a direct inclusion relationship between ontologies - when ontology A imports ontology B, all of B's content becomes part of A's logical space.

Basic syntax:

turtle
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .

<http://example.org/my-ontology> 
    a owl:Ontology ;
    owl:imports <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> ,
                <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .
What happens during import:

1. Transitive inclusion - All triples from imported ontologies become available:

turtle
# In FOAF ontology
foaf:Person a owl:Class .
foaf:name a owl:DatatypeProperty .

# In your ontology (after import)
# You can now use foaf:Person and foaf:name as if they were defined locally
ex:Employee rdfs:subClassOf foaf:Person .
2. Recursive imports - If A imports B, and B imports C, then A gets C's content too

3. Namespace resolution - Imported ontology URIs must be dereferenceable to get the actual content

Key characteristics:

At the ontology level (.9):

Import statements go on owl:Ontology resources, not individual classes/properties
Creates dependency relationships between ontologies
Imported content becomes part of the importing ontology's closure
Processing requirements:

Tools must fetch and parse imported ontologies
Creates a single merged graph for reasoning/validation
Can create circular dependencies (tools should detect/handle)
Practical effects:

turtle
# Without imports - undefined reference
ex:Person rdfs:subClassOf foaf:Person .  # Error: foaf:Person unknown

# With imports - works fine  
<> owl:imports <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .
ex:Person rdfs:subClassOf foaf:Person .  # OK: foaf:Person available
For your flow ontology (.85), owl:imports would be valuable for:

Importing foundational vocabularies (FOAF, DC, DCAT)
Modular ontology design (core + extensions)
Reusing established vocabularies rather than reinventing
It's one of the OWL features worth keeping even without reasoning.




I love the open world assumption. I want to say that every animal has a biological parent, but not have to say who that parent is. How does Shacl accomodate unknowns like that?

Edit
SHACL struggles with this because it's fundamentally closed-world (.8). Your example perfectly illustrates why the open world assumption is beautiful for modeling reality.

The problem with SHACL's approach:

turtle
# What you want to express (OWL style)
ex:Animal rdfs:subClassOf [
    a owl:Restriction ;
    owl:onProperty ex:hasBiologicalParent ;
    owl:minCardinality 2
] .

# This says "every animal has biological parents" 
# without requiring you to state who they are
SHACL's closed-world limitation:

turtle
# SHACL approach
ex:AnimalShape a sh:NodeShape ;
    sh:targetClass ex:Animal ;
    sh:property [
        sh:path ex:hasBiologicalParent ;
        sh:minCount 2  # FAILS if parents aren't explicitly stated
    ] .
SHACL workarounds (all imperfect):

1. Conditional validation:

turtle
sh:property [
    sh:path ex:hasBiologicalParent ;
    sh:minCount 2 ;
    sh:severity sh:Info  # Downgrade to warning, not error
] .
2. Context-specific shapes:

turtle
# Only validate when you're in "complete data" context
ex:CompleteAnimalDataShape a sh:NodeShape ;
    sh:targetNode ex:SpecificAnimal123 ;  # Target known-complete individuals
    sh:property [
        sh:path ex:hasBiologicalParent ;
        sh:minCount 2
    ] .
3. Unknown value markers:

turtle
# Explicitly state "unknown but exists"
ex:Animal123 ex:hasBiologicalParent ex:UnknownParent1, ex:UnknownParent2 .
ex:UnknownParent1 a ex:UnknownEntity .
The fundamental tension (.9):

OWL reasoning: "Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence"
SHACL validation: "If it's not stated, it's missing"
For your flow ontology, you might want:

Use OWL restrictions for logical constraints like "animals have biological parents"
Use SHACL for data quality constraints like "in our employee database, every person must have a stated email"
This is one area where OWL's open-world semantics genuinely provides something that SHACL cannot replicate. The question is whether you need that expressivity for your mesh modeling use case.




what does psuedo-immutability mean to my meshes

Edit
Pseudo-immutability means content appears unchanging from the outside while still being technically editable (.9). For your meshes, this creates some interesting design tensions.

What pseudo-immutability looks like in practice:

Historical dataset URLs (/dataset/_v1/) should never change content
But you might need to fix critical errors, add metadata, or handle legal requirements
Expectation: External systems can cache and rely on versioned content
Reality: Sometimes you need escape hatches
Challenges for your mesh design:

Version integrity vs. practical needs:

/my-ontology/_data/_v1/ontology.ttl  
# Should never change... but what if there's a critical typo?
# What if legal requires removing certain content?
# What if you need to add provenance metadata retroactively?
External references:

Other meshes might import your versioned datasets
Academic papers might cite specific versions
APIs might depend on stable versioned content
Breaking immutability breaks these dependencies
Possible approaches:

1. True immutability with amendments:

/dataset/_v1/              ← Original, never changes
/dataset/_v1-amended/      ← Fixed version with clear provenance
/dataset/_v1-errata/       ← Separate error corrections
2. Pseudo-immutability with clear metadata:

turtle
# In the dataset itself
<dataset_v1> 
    dct:modified "2025-01-06T15:30:00"^^xsd:dateTime ;
    flow:amendment "Fixed critical typo in line 47" ;
    flow:originalHash "abc123..." .
3. Immutable content, mutable metadata:

Core data files stay unchanged
Only _meta datasets can be updated
Corrections/retractions go in metadata, not data
Your mesh's pseudo-immutability contract (.8) probably needs:

Clear versioning promises - What changes break immutability?
Amendment procedures - How do you handle necessary changes?
Notification mechanisms - How do dependents learn about changes?
Provenance tracking - Full audit trail of any modifications
The key is being transparent about your immutability guarantees rather than pretending absolute immutability when practical needs might require flexibility.




what are the benefits of immutable data in general

Edit
Immutable data provides fundamental guarantees that enable reliable, distributed, and concurrent systems (.9). Here are the key benefits:

System Reliability & Consistency
Eliminates race conditions - Multiple processes can read immutable data simultaneously without coordination or locks. No possibility of seeing partial updates or inconsistent state.

Simplifies caching - Once cached, immutable data never needs invalidation checks. Cache can live forever without staleness concerns.

Predictable behavior - Functions operating on immutable data are deterministic. Same input always produces same output, enabling confident testing and debugging.

Collaboration & Distribution
Safe sharing - Immutable references can be passed freely between systems, teams, or organizations without fear of unexpected changes.

Conflict-free replication - Distributed systems can replicate immutable data without merge conflicts. Each version is a distinct, stable artifact.

Reliable citations - Academic papers, legal documents, and API contracts can reference specific immutable versions with confidence they won't change.

Auditability & Compliance
Complete history - Every change creates a new version rather than overwriting. Full audit trail emerges naturally.

Reproducible results - Research, analyses, and computations can be exactly reproduced by referencing the same immutable inputs.

Legal/regulatory compliance - Many domains require tamper-evident records. Immutability provides cryptographic provenance guarantees.

Development Benefits
Easier reasoning - Developers can understand code behavior without tracking mutation side-effects. Significantly reduces cognitive load.

Safer refactoring - Changes can't accidentally break existing code that holds references to immutable data.

Simplified testing - Test fixtures stay stable. No need to reset mutable state between tests.

Performance Advantages
Structural sharing - New versions can reuse unchanged portions of previous versions, making "copying" efficient.

Optimization opportunities - Compilers and databases can apply aggressive optimizations knowing data won't change.

Lazy evaluation - Immutable data enables sophisticated lazy computation strategies.

Trade-offs
Storage overhead - Multiple versions consume more space than single mutable copies.

Memory pressure - Long-lived immutable structures can accumulate if not garbage collected properly.

API complexity - Updates require explicit version creation rather than in-place modification.

For your semantic mesh, immutability enables trusted data sharing, reliable provenance, and confident collaboration - essential for building systems others can depend on (.85).




why shouldn't a data mesh go full-immutability like xtdb

Edit
Full immutability like XTDB creates significant practical friction for iterative data development (.85), especially in your semantic mesh context.

Development Workflow Friction
Iterative ontology development becomes painful - Building an ontology requires constant refinement, testing, and adjustment. With full immutability:

# Instead of editing /my-ontology/_data/_current/ontology.ttl
# You'd need: 
/my-ontology/_data/_t2025-01-06T14:30:00Z/ontology.ttl  # Version 1
/my-ontology/_data/_t2025-01-06T14:31:15Z/ontology.ttl  # Fixed typo
/my-ontology/_data/_t2025-01-06T14:32:42Z/ontology.ttl  # Added property
Working memory overload - Developers would need to track temporal coordinates for every edit session rather than simple "current working version."

Tool compatibility - Most RDF tools expect to work with stable file paths, not timestamp-versioned URLs.

Storage & Performance Costs
Exponential storage growth - Every keystroke potentially creates a new immutable version. Your mesh would accumulate thousands of micro-versions during development.

Query complexity - Simple "get current data" becomes "get data as-of latest time" with temporal predicates throughout SPARQL queries.

Cache invalidation - URLs constantly change, making external caching impossible and forcing refetches of essentially unchanged data.

Semantic Web Integration Issues
External vocabulary alignment - You can't update namespace imports or vocabulary mappings without creating new temporal versions, breaking external references.

Aggregated distributions - Your convenience distributions would need temporal coordinates, but which timestamp represents "the ontology"?

Discovery friction - Humans browsing your mesh want "current state," not temporal archaeology for routine access.

The XTDB Difference
XTDB works because it's a database - Applications query "current state" through temporal predicates. The immutability is hidden behind query abstractions.

Your mesh is a publication platform - External consumers need stable, human-readable URLs for current content, not database temporal queries.

Different use cases - XTDB serves applications needing audit trails and temporal queries. Your mesh serves knowledge sharing and collaboration.

Hybrid Approach Benefits
Development agility with _current/ - Edit freely during development without timestamp friction.

Publication stability with _v1/, _v2/ - Immutable versions when content is ready for external consumption.

Temporal precision when needed - Add XTDB-style temporal tracking for high-value datasets requiring detailed audit trails.

Tool compatibility - Standard RDF tools work naturally with stable current URLs.

Your approach gets 90% of immutability's benefits (reliable references, provenance, safe sharing) while maintaining practical usability for iterative knowledge work (.9).




just remember, editing happens in _next

Edit
You're absolutely right (.9) - I keep forgetting your actual workflow. The editing happens in _next/, not _current/.

Your actual development cycle:

/my-ontology/_data/
├── _current/               ← Stable, published version
│   └── ontology.ttl
├── _next/                  ← Active editing/development
│   └── ontology.ttl        ← Edit here freely
└── _v1/                    ← Historical immutable version
    └── ontology_v1.ttl
This design is actually brilliant (.85) because it gives you:

Development freedom - Edit _next/ as much as you want without affecting published content

Staging area - _next/ serves as your working branch before promotion to _current/

Publication control - _current/ only changes when you deliberately promote from _next/ during weaving

External stability - External systems can rely on _current/ URLs being stable between your publication cycles

So your hybrid approach already solves the full-immutability friction problem I was describing. You get:

Iteration freedom in _next/
Publication stability in _current/
Historical immutability in _vN/
The workflow naturally separates "development mode" (edit _next/) from "publication mode" (promote to _current/) - much cleaner than XTDB's temporal everything approach.

Thanks for the correction - your _next/ design is much more thoughtful than I was giving it credit for.




Can you re-open the example artifact?

Edit

Updated Mesh Layout Example
Document ∙ Version 7 
I've updated the example mesh layout to show that _ref/ datasets are OPTIONAL for data nodes. Notice how some data nodes (like self-contained playlists) might not need reference datasets since their data is already self-describing, while others (like the bio dataset) might benefit from additional contextual reference information.

The structure now clearly shows the _current/ and _next/ workflow you've designed, with editing happening in _next/ before promotion to _current/ during weaving.




I think we're going with the "flow ontology", repo name flow-ontology.

Should the software components be flow-api, flow-cli, flow-service (instead of sflo*)

Edit
Yes, "flow-" prefix is much better (.9). It's:

More consistent with the ontology:

flow-ontology (the core vocabulary)
flow-cli (command line tools)
flow-api (programmatic interface)
flow-service (web services)
Cleaner branding:

Everything under the "Flow" ecosystem
No need to explain what "sflo" means
Obvious connection between components
Better discoverability:

GitHub search for "flow-" will find all related repos
Package managers will group them naturally
Documentation can reference "Flow tooling" collectively
Suggested naming:

flow-ontology - The core RDF vocabulary
flow-cli - Command line mesh management tools
flow-api - REST/GraphQL API for mesh operations
flow-service - Backend services (weaving, validation, etc.)
flow-web - Web interface for browsing/editing meshes
flow-js - JavaScript client library
flow-py - Python client library
GitHub organization structure:

github.com/semantic-flow/
├── flow-ontology/
├── flow-cli/
├── flow-api/
├── flow-service/
