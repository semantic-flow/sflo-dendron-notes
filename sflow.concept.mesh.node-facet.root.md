The node at the top of a repository file hierarchy may be referred to as the root node. It is the [[sflow.concept.namespace.root]], even if it is not a [[sflow.concept.mesh.resource.node.namespace]]. 

Every [[sflow.concept.mesh.resource]] in a mesh "lives under" the root folder.

It is not treated or represented any differently than any other [[sflow.concept.mesh.resource.node]].
