You said:
Are mesh nodes truly holonic.
ChatGPT said:

Let’s slow down and pick this apart carefully.

Holonic (from Arthur Koestler’s "holon") means:

    A thing is simultaneously a whole (with its own identity and integrity),

    and a part of a larger whole (nested within a bigger structure).

Holons are recursive: each whole/part may itself contain holons.
Applying this to mesh nodes (in Semantic Flow / Kosmion terms):

    A mesh node is an identifiable unit in the mesh (it has its own IRI, _ref, _data, _meta, etc.).

    It is also always part of a larger mesh, never entirely free-standing, because every node is contained in a namespace or dataset series.

    Conversely, it can contain other mesh nodes (e.g. a namespace node containing dataset nodes, or dataset nodes containing system/data elements).

So:

    As wholes: a node has its own catalog, distributions, metadata, and potentially web-facing page.

    As parts: it is always nested in a containing namespace, repo, or mesh.

    As recursive: the structure repeats—namespaces contain nodes, which may themselves contain other nodes.

Where it gets nuanced:

    Nodes are not arbitrary composites: they’re governed by structural rules (e.g. a namespace node can contain other nodes and up to one _assets). This means they’re holonic within constraints.

    Nodes are addressable as individuals, but also structural components in a semantic mesh. This makes them slightly different from Koestler’s holons, which emphasize emergent behavior rather than imposed schema.

    Holons are often conceived as autonomous yet dependent. Mesh nodes are only partially autonomous: a node’s identity (IRI) can stand alone, but its interpretability depends on the mesh around it.

My take:

Mesh nodes are holonic by design intention:

    They’re recursively composable, both wholes and parts.

    They inherit identity but also contribute to higher-order identity.

    They fit the holon pattern more cleanly than, say, RDF triples do.

But:

    They are system-holons (structurally defined), not organic holons (emergent).

    Their holonic nature is therefore closer to holarchy in software engineering than to Koestler’s full philosophical holons.

👉 Do you want me to lean this answer toward the philosophical argument (e.g. Kosmion’s ontology and relators) or toward the software-engineering view (Semantic Flow’s folder/IRI structure)?
You said:
Actually, it's possible to have a single-node mesh. Nodes are contained in other nodes, so yes, can be contained in a namespace node, but not in a dataset series, only in a data node. I don't think I agree that interpretability depends much on the mesh around it. Why do you think that?
ChatGPT said:

Good correction — let me realign with what you’re saying.
1. Single-node meshes

Yes: a namespace node that has no children, or even just one data node, is still a valid mesh. That strengthens the holonic claim, because a holon doesn’t require a context above itself to still be a whole. So a single-node mesh is like a holon that is temporarily “just whole, not part.”
2. Containment clarification

You’re right:

    Nodes can be contained in namespace nodes or data nodes.

    Not in dataset series themselves — dataset series are about versioning and don’t act as containers in the same way.

So the holarchy is:
mesh → namespace node → data node → possibly further nodes.

That’s a neat recursion.
3. Interpretability and context

I said “interpretability depends on the mesh around it” because I was thinking of:

    Catalog cross-references (e.g., <_catalog> tells you what datasets/series exist).

    Inverse properties (sometimes a relationship is only visible if both directions are present).

    Dereferenceability (e.g., an IRI is “live” if it’s hosted within a namespace site).

But in truth, you could interpret a node in isolation as long as:

    You have its _ref (for the referent),

    Its _data (if it has one),

    Its _meta (for provenance, etc.).

That’s enough to give the node internal meaning, even outside its enclosing mesh.

So a mesh node is self-interpretable (holon as whole), but also context-augmented when nested (holon as part). That’s probably the better framing.

✅ Revised position:
Mesh nodes are holonic because they are designed to be both:

    Self-standing: a single-node mesh is legitimate and interpretable.

    Recursive parts: nodes can contain other nodes or be contained.

    Contextualized: additional interpretability is gained when embedded, but not strictly required.

Would you like me to sketch a holarchy diagram (like a nested circles/tree) showing how mesh nodes function as holons at different levels?
You said:
Just to be clear, all nodes contribute the namespace, not just namespace nodes. so maybe we should rename namespace nodes... "container nodes"?
ChatGPT said:

Ah, that’s an important nuance. Let me unpack it:
1. Contribution to the namespace

If all nodes extend the namespace (because every node mints IRIs under itself), then the distinction “namespace node” vs “data node” isn’t really about which ones contribute naming power — they all do.

    …/person/ (container/“namespace” node)

    …/person/alice/ (data node, but also itself a namespace for its own _ref, _data, etc.)

    …/person/alice/_ref/alice_ref.trig

So yeah: every node acts as a namespace root for its contents.
2. Renaming “namespace nodes”

If “namespace node” is misleading, alternatives might stress its structural role (can contain other nodes) rather than its naming role (which all nodes share). Some options:

    Container node → emphasizes structural containment.

    Enclosure node → softer, still implies holding.

    Envelope node → like a wrapper, but might sound too transient.

    Domain node → suggests a scope of authority.

    Mesh root node → maybe too absolute; works only if you mean top-level.

    Holon node → makes the holonic nature explicit, but maybe redundant.

3. My take

“Container node” is clean and unambiguous:

    Distinguishes between nodes that may contain other nodes vs those that don’t.

    Doesn’t undermine the fact that all nodes are also namespaces.

    Fits with your earlier idea that mesh nodes are holonic (since holons can be containers for sub-holons).

👉 Question for you: do you see data nodes as just “containers with an expected _data series,” or do you want “container node” to be disjoint from “data node”? In other words:

    Are all data nodes containers, but not all containers are data nodes?

    Or are these two different categories?

You said:
Actually, all nodes may contain any other type of node. So given that, "container node" suffers from the same problem as namespace node... it slightly implies that other nodes are not containers. Maybe "empty node"?
ChatGPT said:

Got it — thanks for clarifying. If all nodes can contain other nodes, then you’re right:

    “namespace node” misleadingly implies only those contribute naming.

    “container node” misleadingly implies only those can contain.

So the special case isn’t about naming or containment — it’s about being a node with no required flows of its own.
Why “empty node” almost works

    ✅ It captures that the node is structurally valid without _ref, _data, _meta.

    ✅ It avoids implying exclusivity of naming or containment.

    ❌ But “empty” could sound contentless, whereas the point is that it may contain subnodes, even if it has no intrinsic flows.

Possible refinements

    Bare node → emphasizes minimal structure, but not literally “nothing.”

    Pure node → same idea, but could sound philosophical.

    Shell node → a vessel awaiting content.

    Base node → the foundational type.

    Simple node → contrasts with “flow-bearing” nodes, but a bit bland.

    Neutral node → has no precommitments, can go in any direction.

My lean

I’d suggest “bare node” instead of “empty node”:

    Still suggests “minimal, nothing required.”

    Doesn’t carry the connotation of useless emptiness.

    Pairs nicely with others: bare node, data node, ref node, meta node, etc.

Would you like me to draft a taxonomy of node types (bare, data, ref, meta, etc.) so you can see how the terminology lands when laid out together?
You said:
all nodes require _meta-flows and a _node-handle. Or at least that's what I think, at least upon "weave", if the node doesn't start with a _meta-flow, it'll get one. "Bare node" might be best. Sure, draft me your taxonomy. 
ChatGPT said:

Love it—“bare node” fits your rules nicely. Here’s a crisp taxonomy you can drop into the docs.
Mesh node taxonomy (holonic; all nodes are containers & namespace extenders)
Common invariants (apply to every node)

    Required facets

        _meta-flow (created/seeded by weave if missing)

        _node-handle (stable slug/ID within the parent scope)

    Namespace: every node extends the namespace (i.e., contributes <parentIRI>/<handle>/…)

    Containment: any node may contain any other node(s)

    Versioning: flows may be versioned as dataset series (e.g., v1, v2, …); policy is per-flow

    Uniqueness: _node-handle is unique among siblings

    Exactly-one rule: exactly one _meta-flow per node

Node types (by intended capability, not by exclusivity)

    These are overlapping “profiles.” A single node can satisfy multiple profiles at once.

1) Bare node

    Definition: the minimal, valid node with only the required facets

    Must have: _meta-flow, _node-handle

    May add later: _ref-flow, _data-flow, _config-flow, _assets/

    Use cases: scaffolding, routing, deferred semantics, grouping

    Example:
    /ns/projects/atlas/ (with only _meta-flow and a handle; children can be added later)

2) Reference node

    Definition: a node that declares/clarifies the referent/meaning

    Must have: _meta-flow, _node-handle, _ref-flow

    May add: _data-flow, _config-flow, _assets/

    Use cases: concepts, people, places, ontology terms, class/individual declarations

    Example:
    /ns/persons/alice/_ref/alice_ref.trig

3) Data node

    Definition: a node that carries data distributions (files/graphs/series)

    Must have: _meta-flow, _node-handle, _data-flow

    May add: _ref-flow, _config-flow, _assets/

    Use cases: datasets, snapshots, series, operational/state data

    Notes: nodes are contained in data nodes (not in dataset series directly)

    Example:
    /ns/persons/alice/_data/… (with v1/, v2/ if versioned)

4) Mixed node

    Definition: has both _ref-flow and _data-flow

    Must have: _meta-flow, _node-handle, _ref-flow, _data-flow

    Use cases: entities whose semantics and data live together (common for individuals)

    Example:
    /ns/devices/sensor-42/ providing meaning + measured data

5) Config-bearing node

    Definition: provides operational/configuration overlays for itself or descendants

    Must have: _meta-flow, _node-handle, _config-flow (optional but defining)

    May add: _ref-flow, _data-flow, _assets/

    Use cases: per-node behavior, rendering, policy, validation settings

    Example:
    /ns/sites/demo/_config/…

Attached element trees (not separate node types)

    _assets/: user-provided assets tree (at most one per node).
    Status: an element tree associated with a node; not a node type.

    _x/ (excluded): optional exclusion subtree.
    Status: an element tree; not a node type.

Holonic read

    Whole: each node is self-sufficient (meta + handle; can be a single-node mesh).

    Part: each node nests within a parent and may host children (recursion).

    Context: embedding adds catalogs, inverses, navigation, but interpretation does not require external context if the node carries its own _ref/_data/_meta.

Path & structure examples

/ns/
  projects/
    atlas/                     (Bare or Mixed)
      _meta/…                  (_meta-flow; required)
      _ref/atlas_ref.trig      (optional, makes it a Reference node)
      _data/v1/…               (optional, makes it a Data/Mixed node)
      _config/…                (optional)
      _assets/…                (optional)
      modules/                 (children; any node types)
        ingest/…               (child node)

Validation sketch (informal)

    Node-level

        REQUIRED: _meta-flow present

        REQUIRED: _node-handle present and unique among siblings

        ONE-ONLY: at most one _assets/ element tree

    Flow-level

        _ref-flow / _data-flow / _config-flow each 0..1 per node
        (internally may be series with v* versions)

    Containment

        Children: 0..N nodes of any profile

“Weave” behaviors to note

    Auto-init: On creation or first touch, weave seeds _meta-flow and assigns _node-handle if absent.

    Promotion: Adding _ref-flow / _data-flow turns a bare node into a Reference/Data/Mixed node without renaming.

    Non-series data: Allowed; series is a policy choice per flow.

If you want, I can turn this into a tiny SHACL profile (or JSON Schema-ish) you can drop into Weave’s validation step—your call on SHACL vs TS-first.
You said:
- "Versioning: flows may be versioned as dataset series (e.g., v1, v2, …); policy is per-flow" belongs in a flow taxonomy.
- "Uniqueness: _node-handle is unique among siblings" -- the folder name is the same everywhere; it's the position in the node hierarchy that gives it uniqueness
- I was thinking all Data nodes must have _ref-flow. That's how you know what it's called, although I don't know if label should be mandatory, and maybe some provenance should go there, at the very least... what would be the minimum provenance of the dataset? (i.e., distinct from the node Maybe you don't need a _ref-flow, and we can call those "Bare Data Nodes".
- reminder, we're using "_node-flow" instead of "_meta-flow" now
ChatGPT said:

Perfect — thanks for catching those. Let me rewrite the taxonomy with your corrections in mind.
Mesh Node Taxonomy (revised)
Common invariants (apply to every node)

    Required facets

        _node-flow (seeded by weave if missing)

        _node-handle (the folder name; uniqueness derives from position in the hierarchy, not the handle string itself)

    Namespace: every node extends the namespace (each handle contributes to the path/IRI).

    Containment: any node may contain any other node(s).

    Exactly-one rule: exactly one _node-flow per node.

Node types (profiles)
1) Bare node

    Definition: minimal node, with only _node-flow and _node-handle.

    Purpose: scaffolding, grouping, deferred semantics.

    Example:
    /ns/projects/atlas/ (only _node-flow initially).

2) Reference node

    Definition: declares/clarifies the referent/meaning.

    Must have: _node-flow, _node-handle, _ref-flow.

    Purpose: concepts, people, classes, ontology terms.

    Example:
    /ns/persons/alice/_ref/alice_ref.trig.

3) Data node

    Definition: carries datasets or distributions.

    Must have: _node-flow, _node-handle.

    Variants:

        Standard Data Node: has _ref-flow to name/describe the dataset.

        Bare Data Node: has no _ref-flow; may be used when dataset is self-descriptive, or provenance is minimal.

    Minimum provenance (if _ref-flow present):

        A human/machine label (rdfs:label or equivalent).

        At least one provenance triple (creator, source, or generation event).

        Optional richer provenance (license, attribution, temporal validity).

    Example:
    /ns/persons/alice/_data/v1/alice_data.trig.

4) Mixed node

    Definition: has both _ref-flow and _data-flow.

    Use case: entities with clear referents and datasets bound together.

    Example:
    /ns/devices/sensor-42/ (referent + telemetry data).

5) Config-bearing node

    Definition: node providing _config-flow.

    May coexist with: _ref-flow, _data-flow.

    Use case: policy, rendering, validation, operational settings.

    Example:
    /ns/sites/demo/_config/demo_config.trig.

Attached element trees

    _assets/: user-provided asset tree (at most one per node).

    _x/: exclusion tree.

Holonic view

    Whole: each node has its own _node-flow, _node-handle, and can be a single-node mesh.

    Part: each node nests within a parent node.

    Context: interpretation is self-sufficient but gains navigation/discovery when embedded in a larger mesh.

✅ Key changes from earlier draft:

    Versioning moved out (belongs to a flow taxonomy).

    _node-flow replaces _meta-flow.

    Clarified uniqueness: handle + position in hierarchy, not handle alone.

    Data nodes clarified: they usually have _ref-flow, but Bare Data Nodes are possible.

    Minimum provenance for datasets sketched.

Do you want me to enumerate flow taxonomy separately (e.g. _node-flow, _ref-flow, _data-flow, _config-flow, with versioning rules per flow)?
You said:
I'm a little bit nervous about the _node-flow. It name includes the word node, tempting people to think it might be a node.
ChatGPT said:

That’s a really good instinct to question the name. You’re right — by including “node” in _node-flow, it subtly suggests that the flow is the node, when in fact it’s just the dataset about the node itself. That could definitely confuse people, especially when you’re already teaching them that “nodes” are holonic and compositional.
What the flow actually is

    It’s the self-descriptive dataset of the node.

    It holds metadata about the node as a node, not about the referent (_ref) or its data (_data).

    It is the one flow every node must have.

Alternative names

If you want to remove that “is a node” confusion, candidates might lean into self, identity, core, or intrinsic:

    _self-flow → emphasizes self-descriptiveness.

    _core-flow → highlights foundational role.

    _identity-flow → stresses its link to the node’s identity.

    _about-flow → plain-language, literally “about this node.”

    _handle-flow → because it always pairs with _node-handle.

    _essence-flow → philosophical, but consistent with your “touchstone” vocabulary.

    _root-flow → emphasizes it’s the root dataset for the node.

My lean

If the main risk is people conflating “flow” with “node”:

    _self-flow is probably the clearest: it’s about the node itself, and nobody would confuse “self” with being the node.

    _core-flow also works if you want to suggest centrality and necessity.

Would you like me to mock up how your taxonomy looks if we switch _node-flow → _self-flow (or _core-flow), so you can see if it reads more cleanly?
You said:
_self-flow and _handle-flow seem best. _core-flow is no good, because the centrality is in the _ref and _data-flows
ChatGPT said:

That makes sense — thanks for the clarification.

    ✅ _self-flow: emphasizes that it’s about the node itself, not about what the node points to.

    ✅ _handle-flow: ties it to the identifier, grounding the node in its naming context.

    ❌ _core-flow: misleading, since the real “semantic core” is _ref + _data.

Here’s how the taxonomy reads if we adopt _self-flow (as the required minimum) and note the tie to _handle-flow:
Mesh Node Taxonomy (with _self-flow)
Common invariants (apply to every node)

    Required facets

        _self-flow (seeded by weave if missing).

            Dataset about the node itself: its creation, authorship, classification, etc.

        _handle-flow (the folder name = _node-handle; uniqueness from position in hierarchy).

    Namespace: every node extends the namespace.

    Containment: any node may contain any other node(s).

    Exactly-one rule: exactly one _self-flow per node.

Node types

    Bare node: only _self-flow + _handle-flow.

    Reference node: adds _ref-flow.

    Data node: adds _data-flow.

        Standard Data Node: has _ref-flow too (recommended).

        Bare Data Node: no _ref-flow.

    Mixed node: both _ref-flow and _data-flow.

    Config-bearing node: adds _config-flow.

✅ This avoids the impression that the “node” is the same thing as the _self-flow.
✅ It makes the language more intuitive: “Every node has a _self-flow describing itself.”
✅ _handle-flow makes the link explicit that the folder/slug is not just a filename but a flow-anchored handle.

Do you want me to also draft a flow taxonomy (separate from node taxonomy) where we spell out:

    _self-flow = about the node

    _ref-flow = about the referent

    _data-flow = about the dataset

    _config-flow = about behavior/policy

…and include how versioning attaches per-flow?
You said:
I think I prefer _handle-flow - help unconvince me
ChatGPT said:

Okay, let’s pressure-test your preference for _handle-flow.
1. What the flow really is

The mandatory flow is not just the handle — it’s the dataset that says things like:

    who/what created the node,

    when it was minted,

    maybe its type (“this thing is a mesh node”),

    provenance trails (e.g. Weave run that seeded it).

The handle is just one property (the folder slug) that makes it addressable.
So calling it _handle-flow risks reducing its meaning to “this is where we keep the slug,” when in fact it’s the node-about-itself dataset.
2. Risk of conflation

If you say “every node must have a _handle-flow”, newcomers may reasonably think:

    it’s just a registry of handles,

    or worse, it’s redundant with the folder name.
    That makes it sound mechanical and narrow, instead of conceptual and necessary.

With _self-flow, it’s obvious: this flow is the self-description of the node — of which the handle is one facet.
3. Consistency with other flows

    _ref-flow → about the referent.

    _data-flow → about the dataset.

    _config-flow → about the configuration.

    _self-flow → about the node itself.
    That’s a nice parallel.

But _handle-flow breaks the pattern — it shifts from “about X” to “the thing we use to name X.”
4. Future extensibility

Imagine you later decide a node must carry:

    author, creation date, versioning provenance,

    a default rdfs:label,

    licensing, etc.
    Would you want to tuck all of that under a “handle flow”?
    It will feel awkward: a handle doesn’t naturally imply “all provenance about this node.”
    But self does.

5. Philosophical fit

Since you’ve been describing nodes as holons, each with a minimal self-sufficient dataset,
“self” has a nice resonance. It says: this node carries its own self-knowledge.
“Handle” feels more like a hook than a self.

✅ So the case against _handle-flow:

    It misleads about scope (handle ≠ whole node).

    It breaks symmetry with other flow names.

    It underplays provenance, identity, and classification.

    It may box you in later if you add more requirements.

Do you want me to try sketching what minimum contents a _self-flow would need (so you can see that the handle is just one part, not the essence)?
You said:
The _node-handle has a very special property, it is "how to reference this thing as a node". _config-flow also uses the _node-handle though. I think you're misunderstanding how the handle functions as an identifier for the node. "ns/djradon/_node-handle" references the djradon node, not djradon himself.

But yes, since _config-operational-flow and _config-inheritable-flow will also refer primarily to the handle, _handle-flow might not be the best name.

Maybe _node-flow is best. or maybe we do:
- _node-metadata-flow
- _node-config-operational-flow
- _node-config-inheritable-flow

?
ChatGPT said:

You’re right—I was collapsing two ideas: the node as a first‑class thing vs. the referent. Your handle points at the node, not the person/thing it describes. Given that, your _node-* naming family is clean and explicit.

Here’s a tightened proposal that fits what you outlined:
Recommended naming

    Required (exactly one):
    _node-metadata-flow/ — the node’s self‑descriptive dataset (about the node).

    Optional (0..1 each):
    _node-config-operational-flow/ — execution/render/runtime behavior for this node only.
    _node-config-inheritable-flow/ — defaults/policies intended to flow to descendants.

    Semantic (0..1 each, per your profiles):
    _ref-flow/ — about the referent/meaning.
    _data-flow/ — datasets/distributions about the subject matter.
    (Versioning is per‑flow: v1/, v2/, etc.)

This keeps “node” explicitly in the flows that are about the node, and leaves _ref/_data for semantics & content.
_node-handle (special role, crisp rules)

    What it identifies: the node itself (e.g., …/ns/djradon/_node-handle denotes the djradon node).

    Uniqueness: achieved by path position (sibling handles must not collide).

    Required: every node has exactly one _node-handle.

    Used by configs: both _node-config-operational-flow and _node-config-inheritable-flow target/qualify via the node handle.

Minimum contents
_node-metadata-flow (minimum, machine‑useful)

    node:handle → the stable slug (string)

    prov:wasGeneratedBy or prov:wasAttributedTo (one of: tool run / agent)

    prov:generatedAtTime (xsd:dateTime)

    rdf:type → your class for “MeshNode” (or equivalent)

    Optional but helpful: rdfs:label (human name for the node), dct:license, pav:version (if you ever version the node dataset itself)

_node-config-operational-flow (minimum)

    node:handle (target)

    One or more non‑inheritable directives (e.g., render template, API surface, validation toggles)

_node-config-inheritable-flow (minimum)

    node:handle (as the scope root)

    One or more inheritable directives (e.g., default SHACL shapes, label/URI minting rules, visibility flags)

    A way to indicate inheritance semantics (e.g., node:policy "merge"|"override")

(You can model both configs with the same vocabulary; “operational” vs “inheritable” is about scope semantics.)

Micro‑SHACL sketch (for validators)

    Exactly one _node-metadata-flow per node.

    Exactly one _node-handle literal (non‑empty, path‑safe).

    _node-config-operational-flow and _node-config-inheritable-flow each 0..1; both must reference the same node handle.

    _ref-flow/_data-flow each 0..1; versioning rules enforced inside those flows.

Why this naming works

    Keeps “node” only where the subject is the node (metadata/config), avoiding confusion with referents or data.

    Preserves your special semantics for _node-handle without overloading the metadata flow’s meaning.

    Scales cleanly as you add policies (you can always add new _node-config-* flavors without touching semantics).

If you want, I can expand the SHACL into a ready‑to‑run shapes file next.

could you provide a brief wiki note for a reference flow
ChatGPT said:

Here’s a tight wiki-style entry you could drop straight into your docs:
_ref-flow

Definition
A _ref-flow is a dataset within a mesh node that provides information about the referent of the node — i.e., the thing in the world that the node stands for.

Purpose

    To declare what the node refers to (person, place, concept, dataset, etc.).

    To supply human/machine labels, identifiers, and minimal provenance about the referent.

    To differentiate between metadata about the node itself (_node-metadata-flow) and metadata about the referent.

Contents (typical minimum)

    rdfs:label (human-readable name of the referent).

    rdf:type (classifying what kind of thing the referent is).

    Optional provenance (creator, source, temporal scope).

    Optional identifiers (sameAs links, external URIs).

Multiplicity

    At most one _ref-flow per node.

    Optional, but strongly recommended for data nodes (to ground the dataset in a named referent).

Examples

    For a person node: name, type foaf:Person, external identifier.

    For a sensor node: label, type iot:Sensor, link to manufacturer URI.

Contrast

    _node-metadata-flow: about the node as a node.

    _data-flow: about the dataset or distributions attached to the node.

    _config-flow: about policy or behavior of the node.

Want me to sketch a JSON-LD example snippet for a _ref-flow as well (say, for a person)?
You said:
Example snippet in TTL please.
ChatGPT said:

Here’s a compact Turtle example of a _ref-flow for a person node (djradon).

@prefix ex:   <https://ns.example.org/> .
@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix prov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#> .
@prefix xsd:  <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

# The referent of the node (the actual person)
ex:persons/djradon#this
    a foaf:Person ;
    rdfs:label "David Richardson" ;
    foaf:mbox <mailto:djradon@example.org> ;
    prov:wasAttributedTo ex:agents/data-curator ;
    prov:generatedAtTime "2025-08-23T17:40:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime .

🔑 Notes:

    ex:persons/djradon#this is the referent (distinguished from the node itself).

    Minimal fields: rdf:type, rdfs:label.

    Provenance (prov:*) attaches to the referent description, not to the node.

    The _ref-flow would live at:

    /ns/persons/djradon/_ref-flow/djradon_ref.ttl

Do you want me to also show how the node’s _node-metadata-flow would point at this _ref-flow, so the relationship between “node” and “referent” is explicit?
You said:
give me a quick note defining referent
ChatGPT said:

Here’s a succinct wiki-style note you can slot into your docs:
Referent

Definition
A referent is the thing in the world that a mesh node stands for. It is the subject of reference, distinct from the node itself (which is a structural element of the mesh).

In practice

    The referent is described in the node’s _ref-flow.

    It may be a concrete entity (e.g., a person, device, location) or an abstract one (e.g., a concept, class, dataset).

    The referent is what other data and statements “point to” when they use the node’s IRI.

Contrast

    Node: a container within the mesh, always has _node-metadata-flow.

    Referent: the external or conceptual thing the node is about, captured in _ref-flow.

Example
Node: https://ns.example.org/persons/djradon/
Referent: https://ns.example.org/persons/djradon#this (a foaf:Person).

Would you like me to also show how to systematically distinguish IRIs for node vs referent in your namespace design (so people don’t mix them up)?
You said:
no fragment identifiers. the node's IRI is an identifier for the referent. To refer to a node, you use a node handle. The referent may include imaginary things.
ChatGPT said:
Referent

Definition
The referent is the thing (real or imaginary) that a node’s IRI identifies. In this model, the node’s IRI is the identifier of the referent—no fragment identifiers are used.

Node vs. referent

    Referent: the subject the IRI names (can be concrete, abstract, or fictional).

    Node: the mesh container that carries flows about that subject. You reference the node via its node handle, not via the IRI.

Where it’s described

    The referent’s attributes live in the node’s _ref-flow.

    The node itself (its provenance, scaffolding, policies) is described in _node-* flows (e.g., _node-metadata-flow, _node-config-*).

Example (no fragments)

    Referent IRI: https://ns.example.org/persons/djradon/ (identifies the person).

    Node handle: persons/djradon (used to talk about the node/container).

You said:
the node handle would be https://ns.example.org/persons/djradon/_node-handle (published IRI) or just <djradon/_node-handle> (mesh identifier). I would say "the referent's description lives in the node's _ref-flow"
ChatGPT said:

Got it 👍 — let me re-express cleanly with your corrections baked in:
Referent

Definition
The referent is the thing (real or imaginary) that a node’s IRI identifies. Every node IRI is an identifier for its referent.

Node vs. referent

    Referent: the external or conceptual thing that the node’s IRI names.

    Node: the mesh construct (with flows and handle) that manages information about that referent.

        To talk about the node itself, you use its node handle (e.g. published IRI https://ns.example.org/persons/djradon/_node-handle or mesh identifier <djradon/_node-handle>).

Where it’s described

    The referent’s description lives in the node’s _ref-flow.

    The node’s own metadata and provenance live in the _node-* flows (e.g. _node-metadata-flow, _node-config-*).

Example

    Referent IRI: https://ns.example.org/persons/djradon/ (identifies the person).

    Node handle: https://ns.example.org/persons/djradon/_node-handle (identifies the node that contains flows about that referent).

Do you want me to also draft a parallel wiki note for “Node handle” so it sits right next to “Referent” in your docs?
You said:
let's also just touch on the case of a data node, where the referent is a evolvable dataset that lives in the data node.
ChatGPT said:

Perfect — here’s an extended wiki note that folds in that case:
Referent

Definition
The referent is the thing (real or imaginary) that a node’s IRI identifies. Every node IRI is an identifier for its referent.

Node vs. referent

    Referent: the subject that the node’s IRI names (a person, concept, device, dataset, etc.).

    Node: the mesh construct that manages flows about that referent.

        To talk about the node itself, you use its node handle (e.g. published IRI https://ns.example.org/persons/djradon/_node-handle or mesh identifier <djradon/_node-handle>).

Where it’s described

    The referent’s description lives in the node’s _ref-flow.

    The node’s own metadata and provenance live in the _node-* flows (e.g. _node-metadata-flow, _node-config-*).

Special case: Data nodes

    In a data node, the referent is not a static entity but an evolvable dataset.

    The dataset grows through versioned distributions inside the node’s _data-flow (e.g. v1/, v2/, …).

    The _ref-flow still gives the dataset its name, type, and minimal provenance (so it can be cited, labeled, or linked externally).

    Example:

        Node IRI: https://ns.example.org/projects/atlas/

        Referent: the Atlas dataset (identified by the node IRI, evolving over time).

        _ref-flow: declares it as a dataset, supplies label and attribution.

        _data-flow: provides concrete versions (v1, v2, …).

👉 Would you like me to also draft the paired wiki note for “Node handle”, so your docs have “Referent” and “Node handle” defined side-by-side?
You said:
I need a way to describe all the parts of the Semantic Flow platform, whether mesh resources (nodes and elements), filesystem pieces (defined files and folders), ontologies, facets, and conventions. "Platform elements" would be good but I'm already using elements for resources. What's a synonym for elements, or something else suitable? Or I could replace (resource) elements with a better term, maybe "node components"  (i.e., flows, asset folders, resource pages)

I guess a mesh must have a root node, and everything is contained within a node, so I think all mesh elements are actually node elements.
ChatGPT said:

Yeah — you’ve hit on the crux: you need one umbrella word for “all the definable parts of the Semantic Flow platform,” and a narrower word for the sub-parts of a node (flows, assets, resource pages). Right now element is doing too much work.
1. For the umbrella category (everything in the platform)

Instead of “platform elements,” you could use:

    Platform constituents → neutral, clear.

    Platform components → strong engineering flavor.

    Platform constructs → emphasizes “things you build with.”

    Platform artifacts → emphasizes their stored, file-like nature.

    Platform units → emphasizes that they’re countable and modular.

👉 Of these, constructs feels closest to your “ontology + convention + filesystem + node” scope.
2. For node sub-parts (flows, asset trees, resource pages)

If you don’t want “elements,” candidates are:

    Node components → as you said, makes sense: these are the constituent pieces of a node.

    Node facets → evocative, but you’re already considering “facets” for something emergent.

    Node layers → could fit if you see _ref, _data, _config as layers of description.

    Node slices → works if you like the “cut” metaphor (temporal or structural).

    Node aspects → softer, but similar to “facets.”

👉 “Node components” is probably the clearest, since they are the designed structural parts of a node (flows, assets, pages).
3. Reconciling

If you adopt:

    Platform constructs = umbrella (ontologies, filesystem conventions, node structures, etc.)

    Node components = sub-parts of a node (flows, assets, pages)

…then the taxonomy reads cleanly:

    Meshes are built of nodes.

    Nodes are built of node components.

    The platform is made of constructs (nodes, node components, files, ontologies, conventions, etc.).

Would you like me to draft a two-level glossary sketch that lays these out in a consistent way (Constructs → Nodes → Node components), so you can see how they all slot together?
You said:
Hmm... maybe "Platform elements" and "Node components". 
ChatGPT said:

That works really well, actually — crisp separation of scopes:

    Platform elements → everything that makes up Semantic Flow: nodes, node components, filesystem conventions, ontologies, naming rules, etc.

    Node components → the parts inside a node: flows, assets folders, resource pages.

It preserves your existing “element” vocabulary at the higher (platform) level, while reserving “components” for the structural pieces of a node.
How it could read in docs

Platform elements

    The Semantic Flow platform is defined in terms of platform elements. Platform elements include mesh resources (nodes and their components), filesystem structures (special files and folders), ontologies, facets, and conventions.

Node components

    Every mesh node is built from node components, such as flows (_ref-flow, _data-flow, _node-metadata-flow), asset trees (_assets/), and resource pages (index.html, index.trig). Node components are always contained in a node and do not exist independently.

This way, someone scanning your docs sees a clear hierarchy:

    Platform elements (the whole platform’s definitional parts)

        Mesh nodes (one kind of platform element)

            Node components (the internal substructure of nodes)

Would you like me to sketch a mini diagram/tree of this hierarchy so it’s easy to visualize?
You said:
I've refactored elements to be node-components. Now, hierarchically, "resources pages" and other documentation resources (CHANGELOG and README) are considered node-components. But at least "resource pages" (and maybe CHANGELOG and README) can be contained in nodes or node-components. Sure, components can only be contained in nodes, but I'm almost thinking that documentation resources are a 3rd kind of resource. It would give them better visibility, and underscore that they are not just node components.

The other thought here: asset trees are formerly only available at the node level, i.e., unversioned. But perhaps theres an argument to be made for making asset trees placeable any where. Things are simpler if they stay with nodes, since nodes aren't directly versioned, we don't have to worry about copy asset trees around.
ChatGPT said:

Love this direction. Here’s a clean way to model it without muddying “node-components,” while giving docs real visibility and keeping assets sane.
Proposed hierarchy

    Platform elements (umbrella)

        Nodes (holonic containers; namespace-extenders)

            Node-components (flows, configs, etc.)

            Doc resources (new first‑class kind; see below)

1) Make “Doc resources” a third kind (not a node‑component)

Why

    They’re not part of the node’s operational structure like flows/configs.

    You want visibility, stable URLs, and clear separation from semantics.

Definition

    Human-/reader-facing artifacts about a node or a component.

    Examples: index.html, index.trig, README.md, CHANGELOG.md, ADRs, diagrams.

Containment rules

    Doc resources may be contained by:

        a node (node‑scoped docs),

        or a node-component (component‑scoped docs).

    Doc resources do not contain nodes (but can contain other doc resources).

    Node-components never contain nodes (but can contain doc resources).

Conventions (strongly recommended)

    Use a dedicated _docs/ folder as the doc root at each scope:

        Node‑scoped docs: …/node/_docs/*

        Component‑scoped docs: …/node/_ref-flow/_docs/*, …/node/_data-flow/_docs/*, etc.

    Keep resource pages (index.html, index.trig) at the node root for dereferenceability, and mirror/explain deeper docs under _docs/.

Example

/ns/devices/sensor-42/
  _node-metadata-flow/…
  _ref-flow/…
    _docs/               # docs about the referent spec, mappings, etc.
  _data-flow/
    v1/…
    v2/…
    _docs/               # docs about dataset versions, schemas, changelogs
  _docs/                 # node-level README, overview, diagrams
  index.html             # resource page (node entry)
  index.trig             # resource page (node entry data)

2) Keep asset trees at the node level (recommended), but support component-scoped mounts

You’re right: letting assets live “anywhere” complicates versioning/copying. Here’s a compromise:

Policy

    Authoritative assets live in node/_assets/ (one per node).

    Components can declare “asset mounts”—logical links to subsets inside node/_assets/.

How it works

    In a component (e.g., _data-flow), place a small manifest (e.g., _assets.mount.jsonld) that lists the assets it uses (paths within the node’s _assets/).

    Weave resolves mounts at build time:

        For static sites: generate stable URLs (no physical copy required).

        For immutable/versioned flows: optionally materialize a content‑hashed copy under node/_assets/_v/<hash>/… so v1/v2 point to immutable blobs without duplicating authoring locations.

Why this is nice

    Authors keep assets in one place (node).

    Components get precise, version‑safe references when needed.

    No explosion of _assets/ folders deep in component trees.

Optional extension

    Allow component‑local assets only if they’re content‑hashed (enforced by weave) so you avoid mutable copies inside versioned components.

3) Quick cardinality + rules

    Nodes

        contain: 0..N nodes, 0..N node-components, 0..1 _assets/, 0..N doc resources (_docs/, index.*, README, CHANGELOG, ADRs)

    Node-components

        contain: 0..N doc resources (_docs/), 0..1 asset mount manifest (not an assets tree)

        do not contain nodes

    Doc resources

        contain: 0..N doc resources

        do not contain nodes or node-components

4) Navigation & visibility

    Node landing = index.html / index.trig at node root (resource pages).

    Deep docs live under _docs/ at the node or component where they apply.

    Weave can auto‑index _docs/ at each scope, presenting:

        Node overview (node _docs/)

        Referent docs (ref _docs/)

        Dataset/docs (data _docs/)

        Changelogs (prefer component‑scoped _docs/CHANGELOG.md near _data-flow)

5) Minimal vocab hooks (sketch)

    sf:DocResource class for things under _docs/ (README, ADR, diagram, etc.).

    sf:assetMount on a node‑component → list of sf:assetPath (relative to node/_assets/).

    sf:mountResolution policy: "virtual" | "materialize-hashed".

6) Migration guidance (from “resource pages are node-components”)

    Move doc files into _docs/ at the appropriate scope (node or component).

    Keep index.html / index.trig at node root as resource pages (entry points).

    For any component that referenced private assets, add an _assets.mount.jsonld (or TTL) to declare mounts pointing into node/_assets/.

TL;DR

    Promote Doc resources to a third kind (peer to nodes & node-components) for clarity and visibility.

    Keep assets at node level for simplicity; let components mount what they need.

    Use _docs/ at node and component scopes; reserve index.* at node root for dereferenceable entry pages.

You said:
Regarding 2), I don't know if components use assets directly, they are only really used in resource pages. Which can have templates and associated css and images/other media. If we go with a single assets tree per node, we have to make it immutable. Because every snapshot version (like every folder resource) gets its own index.html, and that index.html might refer to an image, and to preserve history, that image usually shouldn't be overwritten. So maybe we bite the bullet and allow assets trees in any folder. It would have the nice side effect of not having tons of different layouts, css files, and images all associated with the node.
ChatGPT said:

Totally fair. If only resource pages consume assets, and every version/snapshot has its own index.html, then you need asset immutability at the same scope as that page. Here’s a concrete, low‑friction scheme that embraces assets anywhere, keeps history correct, and avoids asset bloat.
Proposal: Scoped, Immutable Assets (assets-anywhere)
1) Where assets can live

    Allow _assets/ at any folder (node root, any node‑component, any version folder).

    A resource page (index.html / index.trig) uses the nearest ancestor _assets/ by default (closest wins).

    Optional fallback chain: current folder → parent → … → site/theme defaults.

2) Immutability rules

    Versioned scopes (e.g., _data-flow/v3/, _ref-flow/v2/, etc.):

        Any _assets/ under a versioned folder is frozen after publish.

        Writes are blocked (or auto‑fork to a new version).

    Unversioned scopes (e.g., node root, _next/):

        Mutable during authoring.

        On publish, Weave materializes needed assets into the target version’s _assets/ so that the published page references immutable copies.

3) Dedup & storage efficiency

Two non‑exclusive options (you can do both):

    Local materialization (simple):

        Copy files into the version’s _assets/ at publish time.

        Pros: trivial hosting; assets live beside the page.

        Cons: possible duplication across versions.

    Content‑addressed store (efficient):

        Weave writes assets to a site‑wide store (e.g., /docs/_media/sha256/ab/cd/…/file.ext).

        Rewrites index.html URLs to canonical hashed URLs.

        Pros: global dedup, cache‑busting baked in, strong immutability.

        Cons: needs URL rewrite step; slightly less “co‑located” in the tree (but you can keep a small stub in _assets/ that points to the blob).

    Tip: You can keep local materialization for DX and add an optional “hash‑pin” mode that silently resolves to the blob store in production.

4) URL rules for resource pages

    Resource pages must use relative URLs to a local _assets/ (e.g., ./_assets/img/logo.svg) during authoring.

    On publish, Weave:

        Resolves the asset via the nearest _assets/.

        Freezes it (copy or hash‑pin).

        Rewrites the URL in the built page to the immutable location (local copy or blob URL).

5) Lookup algorithm (deterministic)

Given a page P:

    Look for ./_assets/ in P’s folder.

    If not found, climb to parent folder’s _assets/.

    Repeat to node root.

    If still missing, use site/theme default assets (optional).

    If multiple matches exist (rare), closest folder wins.

6) Recommended structure

/ns/things/gizmo/
  index.html
  _assets/                  # node-level shared assets (optional; mutable pre-publish)
  _ref-flow/
    v1/
      index.html
      _assets/              # frozen with v1
    v2/
      index.html
      _assets/              # frozen with v2
  _data-flow/
    v1/
      index.html
      _assets/              # frozen with v1 data presentation
    _next/
      index.html
      _assets/              # mutable during drafting; frozen on release → v2/_assets/

7) Minimal policy (you can encode in SHACL/Weave checks)

    A folder may contain 0..1 _assets/.

    Under any versioned folder, _assets/ is immutable after publish.

    Resource page publish must fail if any referenced asset cannot be resolved & frozen.

    Asset references in published pages must be absolute & immutable (either local version _assets/ path or content‑hash URL).

    Optional: enforce max size or allowed types per scope.

8) Nice extras

    Theme/kit layering: allow a _theme/ ref that supplies defaults; local _assets/ overrides by proximity.

    Manifest: generate an _assets.manifest.json per published page (list of resolved assets + hashes) for reproducibility.

    Orphan sweep: Weave can detect unreferenced assets in versioned _assets/ and report (don’t delete by default).

    ADR: add a short doc (in _docs/) explaining the “assets‑anywhere + immutability” rule for contributors.

TL;DR

    Yes to assets-anywhere: put _assets/ next to the thing that renders.

    Freeze at publish for versioned folders; rewrite resource pages to immutable URLs.

    Use nearest‑ancestor lookup, optional hash store for dedup, and keep authoring UX simple with relative paths.

You said:
Resource pages are always index.html, never RDF like index.trig. 

We can't block writes, but we can prevent weave (or warn) if checksums are off. 

One tricky thing around css/templates... it's not clear whether people want the historical "look-and-feel" for their resource pages. At least sometimes, all old version would be prefered to have same (latest) css/templates. 

Site-wide store is not an option, because it breaks transposability/composability. 

But probably in a similar way to config inheritability, we might want template inheritability. Ugh. No wonder existing semantic sites are all so homogeneous and bland.
ChatGPT said:

Love the constraints. Here’s a tight scheme that keeps index.html-only resource pages, preserves history without a global store, and gives you per-scope control over whether old pages keep the old look or float to the newest.
Resource pages + assets + templates (concise spec)
1) Files & where they live

    Resource page: always index.html (no RDF variants).

    Assets: allow _assets/ in any folder (node root, any flow, any version).

    Templates/CSS: put in a sibling folder named _templates/ (parallel to _assets/) at any scope you want to offer inheritance from.

/ns/foo/
  index.html
  _assets/           # optional (node-scope)
  _templates/        # optional (node-scope)
  _ref-flow/
    v1/
      index.html
      _assets/       # version-scope assets (historical)
      _templates/    # version-scope templates (historical)
    v2/
      index.html

2) Resolution order (nearest-wins)

Given a page at folder F:

    Use assets from the nearest _assets/ (F → parent → … → node root).

    Use templates from the nearest _templates/ (same climb).

    Optional last resort: theme bundled with Weave (if you want).

All authoring paths are relative (e.g., ./_assets/img.png, ./_templates/page.njk).
3) Immutability without blocking writes

    You can’t block edits, so Weave does publish-time integrity:

        Build computes a Render Manifest for each index.html:

            list of resolved assets + checksums,

            list of resolved templates + checksums,

            resolved inheritance chain (folders used).

        If a previously published page is rebuilt and any checksum changes:

            Policy = warn or fail (configurable per scope; see §4).

            Weave prints a diff of changed files (nice DX).

    Historical preservation comes from:

        Keeping version‑local _assets/ / _templates/ for pages you want pinned, or

        Setting policy to pin (below), which auto‑materializes copies.

4) Pin vs Float (per-scope policy)

Add two config keys (in _node-config-operational-flow or _node-config-inheritable-flow):

    sf:view.assetsPolicy: "pin" | "float" | "warn"

    sf:view.templatePolicy: "pin" | "float" | "warn"

Semantics

    pin: on publish, Weave materializes referenced assets/templates into the page’s folder (e.g., ./_assets/ and ./_templates/ next to index.html) and rewrites links to those local copies. Future rebuilds compare to those copies.

    float: Weave uses whatever the resolution chain yields today. Checksums are recorded, but drift is allowed.

    warn: like float, but Weave warns if checksums drift vs last publish.

    You can set these at node root (inheritable), and override at any child folder (flow/version).

5) No site-wide store, still dedup-friendly

    Because you copy within the page’s own subtree for pin, transposability/composability stay intact.

    Dedup is “by-convention”: authors can hoist shared assets/templates to a higher _assets/ / _templates/ so many pages float to them without duplication. Pages that need history lock switch to pin.

6) Publishing rules (Weave)

    For each index.html:

        Resolve assets/templates by nearest-wins.

        Apply policy:

            pin → copy into local _assets/ / _templates/, rewrite URLs.

            float/warn → keep relative URLs; record checksums and chain.

        Emit index.render-manifest.json alongside the page:

        {
          "assetsPolicy": "pin",
          "templatePolicy": "warn",
          "assets": [{"path":"../_assets/img.png","sha256":"…","resolvedFrom":"/ns/foo/_assets/img.png"}],
          "templates": [{"path":"../_templates/page.njk","sha256":"…","resolvedFrom":"/ns/foo/_templates/page.njk"}],
          "chain": {"assets":["./_assets/","../_assets/"], "templates":["./_templates/","../_templates/"]},
          "publishedAt": "2025-08-23T18:10:00Z"
        }

        On rebuild: compare to manifest; warn/fail per policy if drift.

7) Typical modes you’ll want

    Historical look: assetsPolicy=pin, templatePolicy=pin at version folders.

    Keep latest chrome: assetsPolicy=float, templatePolicy=float at node root; override to pin only for special releases.

    Hybrid: assets=pin (logos/images stable), templates=float (layout/css evolves).

8) Lightweight vocab (names you can change)

    sf:view.assetsPolicy, sf:view.templatePolicy with values "pin"|"float"|"warn".

    sf:inheritsDocs (boolean) if you ever want to opt out of documentation inheritance for a branch.

9) Practical guidance for authors

    Always use relative links (./_assets/..., ./_templates/...).

    If a page’s visual must never change, set pin at that folder (or just include local _assets/ / _templates/ from the start).

    For shared look-and-feel, keep templates/CSS higher up; descendants float by default, or override per version.

Net effect:

    You get immutability when you want it (pin), evolution when you want it (float), and safety rails (warn/fail with checksums).

    Everything remains local and portable—no global blob store.

    “Homogeneous and bland” becomes a choice, not a constraint: use float to update the site’s chrome, pin to memorialize a release’s exact look.

You said:
"use assets" sounds simple, but the template would have to specify particular assets. You can't just use the closest because it might not have the asset you need.

Maybe best to keep _assets and _templates at the node level. But yes, there's a composability constraint: templates can't depend on higher-level assets. 
ChatGPT said:

Makes sense. Here’s a tight, composable spec that keeps things simple and predictable:
Node‑scoped templates & assets (no cross‑scope deps)
Rules (summary)

    Location: Only at the node root

        …/node/_templates/ — all page templates/partials for this node

        …/node/_assets/ — all CSS/JS/img/media for this node

    No inheritance across nodes or parents. Templates must not depend on higher‑level assets.

    Version pages (e.g., under _data-flow/vN/) still render using the node’s _templates/ + _assets/ unless you explicitly pin (see below).

Referencing (deterministic)

    Templates reference assets with node‑root‑relative paths (stable within the node):

        Example: /__assets/css/site.css where Weave maps /__assets/ ⇒ ./_assets/

    Resource pages (index.html) compiled from templates must not use ../ climbs.

    Rationale: node‑root references make templates portable inside the node and eliminate ambiguity about “nearest” folders.

Pin vs Float (per folder)

    assetsPolicy: "pin" | "float" | "warn"

    templatePolicy: "pin" | "float" | "warn"

pin (at a version folder): on publish, Weave copies only the referenced _templates/ partials and _assets/ files into the version’s folder, rewrites paths to local copies, and records checksums.
float: version pages keep using the node‑root _templates/ + _assets/ as they evolve.
warn: like float, but warn if checksums drift vs last publish.

(Set defaults in _node-config-inheritable-flow; override per version folder.)
Build‑time validation

    Missing asset/template ⇒ fail the build (no silent fallbacks).

    On republish: compare against the last render manifest; obey pin/float/warn.

Minimal render manifest (next to each built index.html)

Weave config keys (names are placeholders)

    sf:view.assetsPolicy and sf:view.templatePolicy on any folder (inheritable).

    Weave maps:

        /__assets/ → ./_assets/ at node root

        /__templates/ → ./_templates/ at node root

Why this works

    Composability: a node is self‑contained; moving it doesn’t break references.

    Clarity: no “nearest wins” guessing; failures are explicit.

    Control: choose historical fidelity (pin) or evolving chrome (float) per version.

    No global store: all copies stay within the node tree; portable by design.

If you want, I can draft the tiny SHACL (or JSON rules) to validate that:

    node root has at most one _templates/ and one _assets/

    version folders don’t contain _templates/ unless created by pin

    resource pages never climb (../) and only use /__assets/ and /__templates/.

You said:
Non-node resource pages (i.e., component resource pages) can use climbs, but only up to the root.

You may not have picked this up, but another semi-constraint: only nodes have config so assetPolicy and templatePolicy would have to go in node config.  and its generally config is not version aware.

Another thing I should've mentioned. If no templates are present or defined in config, weave will just use the service-level template and template mappings, and if none, platform templates/mappings.
ChatGPT said:

Great constraints. Here’s a tightened spec that reflects them.
Resource pages, templates, and assets — with your rules
1) Where resource pages live & path rules

    Node resource pages: …/node/index.html (no ../ climbs allowed).

    Component resource pages (e.g., in _ref-flow/, _data-flow/):

        May use relative climbs, but only up to the node root (never beyond).

        Recommend using the mapped roots below for clarity.

2) Roots and mapping (stable references)

Weave provides node‑root aliases so templates/assets are easy to reference from any depth:

    /__assets/ → ./_assets/ at the node root

    /__templates/ → ./_templates/ at the node root

Component pages may still use relative paths, but these aliases avoid fragile climbs.
3) Where config lives (only nodes; not version‑aware)

    Only nodes have config; components do not.

    Config is not version‑aware (applies across the node and all descendants).

    Keys live in the node config (operational/inheritable), e.g.:

        sf:view.assetsPolicy: "pin" | "float" | "warn"

        sf:view.templatePolicy: "pin" | "float" | "warn"

Semantics (unchanged):

    pin: on publish, Weave copies just the referenced templates/assets into the page’s own folder, rewrites links, and records checksums.

    float: use node‑root _templates/ and _assets/ as they evolve.

    warn: like float, but warn if checksums drift vs last publish.

    Because config isn’t version‑aware, these policies apply uniformly to all component pages under the node unless Weave supports publish‑time overrides (see §5).

4) Template resolution cascade (when nothing is defined)

When building any index.html, Weave picks the template by this cascade:

    Node config explicit template mapping (if present)

    Node‑root _templates/ (if present)

    Service‑level default templates/mappings (Weave service config)

    Platform‑level default templates/mappings

If no _templates/ at the node and no node config, you still get a page via service/platform defaults.
5) Optional, publish‑time overrides (without “component config”)

If you need exceptions (e.g., pin only for certain version folders) without violating “nodes‑only config,” use a publish directive file that Weave recognizes at build time:

    File: ./.weave-publish.json (in the folder being published)

    Example:

    { "assetsPolicy": "pin", "templatePolicy": "warn" }

    This is not configuration (doesn’t declare behavior), it’s a build directive, scoped to that folder only, and does not introduce version‑aware config.

6) Validation & safety

    Node resource pages must not contain ../ climbs; component pages may climb but Weave enforces “no higher than node root.”

    On publish, Weave emits a render manifest next to each built index.html (checksums of referenced templates/assets and the resolved roots).

    If policies are warn and checksums drift vs last publish, emit warnings; if pin, rewrite to local copies; if float, accept drift silently.

7) Suggested node layout

/ns/things/gizmo/
  _node-metadata-flow/…
  _node-config-inheritable-flow/…   # contains sf:view.* policies (node-scoped)
  _templates/
    page.njk
    partials/header.njk
  _assets/
    css/site.css
    img/logo.svg
  index.html                         # uses /__templates/, /__assets/

  _data-flow/
    v1/
      index.html                     # may climb to node root; obeys node policies
      .weave-publish.json            # (optional) publish-time override
    v2/
      index.html

8) Authoring guidance (DX)

    Prefer /__templates/... and /__assets/... in templates and pages; they’re node‑portable and avoid brittle climbs.

    Component pages can climb (e.g., ../../_assets/img.png) but Weave will reject climbs past the node root.

    If you want old versions to keep the old look, either:

        set node policy to pin (uniform), or

        add a publish directive (.weave-publish.json) to the specific version folders you want pinned.

This keeps:

    Composability: nodes are self-contained; no cross‑node dependencies.

    Simplicity: one _templates/ and _assets/ per node; components reuse them.

    Control: node‑level policies, optional publish‑time overrides for special cases.

    Portability: service/platform fallbacks when a node brings no templates of its own.

You said:
I'm not sure about the aliases. A mesh has to work as a site even in between weaves. Weave isn't a site build, it's version bumper + resource page generator. The resource page in the "current" snapshots would have to "alias" itself when creating the next snapshot. I want them to be expressively similar. Also, flows get resource pages, but flows themselves aren't versions, they only get one resource page, and it always has to be ready to go.
ChatGPT said:

Got it — no runtime aliases, the site must work statically between weaves, and flow pages are always “live.” Here’s a tight scheme that meets those constraints.
Static, alias‑free paths with deterministic depths
Scopes & fixed depths (relative to the node root)

    Node page (node root): depth 0 → paths like ./_assets/...

    Flow page (e.g., _ref-flow/index.html, _data-flow/index.html): depth 1 → paths like ../_assets/...

    Version page (e.g., _data-flow/vN/index.html): depth 2 → paths like ../../_assets/...

    Because the folder layout is fixed, the depth is known. That lets us generate stable, alias‑free relative URLs that work even without a fresh weave.

Templates: compile‑time prefixes, no runtime aliasing

When Weave renders any index.html, it computes two compile‑time constants for that page:

    ASSETS_PREFIX ∈ { "./", "../", "../../" }

    TEMPLATES_PREFIX ∈ { "./", "../", "../../" }

and expands template references like:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ ASSETS_PREFIX }}_assets/css/site.css">
{% include TEMPLATES_PREFIX + "_templates/partials/header.njk" %}

The output HTML contains only plain relative paths (../_assets/...) — no special aliases, no JS, no <base> tag tricks. It’s ready to serve as static files.
Where things live (simple rule)

    Only at the node root:

        _assets/ — all CSS/JS/images for the node

        _templates/ — all templates/partials for the node

    Components never define their own _assets/ or _templates/ (keeps the tree portable and avoids proliferation).

    Flows may have exactly one resource page (index.html) and it must be ready to go (always generated with the correct prefixes).

Policy (node config only; not version‑aware)

Set at the node (applies to all pages beneath it):

    sf:view.assetsPolicy: "pin" | "float" | "warn"

    sf:view.templatePolicy: "pin" | "float" | "warn"

Pin: on publish, copy only the referenced assets/templates into the page’s folder (next to index.html) and rewrite links to ./_assets/… / ./_templates/… (still using the same prefix constants).
Float: leave links pointing up to node‑root _assets/_templates.
Warn: like float, but warn if referenced file checksums drift vs last publish.

    Because config isn’t version‑aware, this stays uniform. If you need exceptions for a specific version folder, you can allow an optional publish directive file (non‑config) there — but only if you decide you need that escape hatch later.

Missing templates (service/platform fallbacks)

Template resolution (no aliases, no indirection):

    If node config maps a template → use that.

    Else if node has _templates/ → use that.

    Else use service‑level defaults.

    Else use platform‑level defaults.

Weave still bakes the final index.html with concrete relative paths based on the page depth.
Checksums & history (no write blocking)

    Weave emits a render manifest next to each index.html recording:

        resolved depth (0|1|2), prefixes used,

        list of referenced assets/templates with checksums,

        policy in effect (pin/float/warn).

    On rebuild:

        pin → ensure local copies match; if not, refresh & rewrite.

        float → allow drift; warn → emit warnings on drift.

Tiny examples

Node page (/ns/thing/ depth 0):

<link rel="stylesheet" href="./_assets/css/site.css">
<img src="./_assets/img/logo.svg">

Flow page (/ns/thing/_data-flow/ depth 1):

<link rel="stylesheet" href="../_assets/css/site.css">
<img src="../_assets/img/logo.svg">

Version page (/ns/thing/_data-flow/v2/ depth 2):

<link rel="stylesheet" href="../../_assets/css/site.css">
<img src="../../_assets/img/logo.svg">

If policy = pin at v2/, Weave copies the needed files beside the page and rewrites to:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="./_assets/css/site.css">
<img src="./_assets/img/logo.svg">

Why this fits your goals

    Works as a static site between weaves (no aliases, no runtime magic).

    Keeps flow resource pages always ready (single page per flow, depth‑1).

    Preserves history when desired (pin) without a global store.

    Maintains composability/portability — the node is self‑contained; paths are purely relative.

You said:
Instead of "Version page", we'll do "snapshot page"

Instead of pin vs float, let's just always have node components depend on the templates and assets present in the node's assets tree, and the template mappings defined in the node operational config, if any. If not, service; then platform
ChatGPT said:

Perfect—here’s the tightened spec with your updates baked in.
Resource pages, templates, and assets (finalized)
Terms

    Node page: …/node/index.html (depth 0)

    Flow page: …/node/_<flow>-flow/index.html (depth 1)

    Snapshot page: …/node/_<flow>-flow/vN/index.html (depth 2)

Flows have exactly one flow page (depth 1) and may have many snapshot pages (depth 2).
Locations (node‑scoped only)

    Templates: …/node/_templates/ (node root)

    Assets: …/node/_assets/ (node root)

    Config (node‑only):

        _node-config-operational-flow (mappings, view rules)

        _node-config-inheritable-flow (policies that apply to descendants)

    Node‑components (flows/snapshots) do not define their own _templates/ or _assets/.

Path rules (alias‑free, static)

    Node page (depth 0): ./_assets/...

    Flow page (depth 1): ../_assets/...

    Snapshot page (depth 2): ../../_assets/...

Component resource pages may use climbs, but never above the node root.

Examples:

<!-- Node page -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./_assets/css/site.css">

<!-- Flow page -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../_assets/css/site.css">

<!-- Snapshot page -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../../_assets/css/site.css">

Dependency model (simple + composable)

    All node‑components (flows + snapshots) depend only on:

        The node’s _templates/ and _assets/

        Template mappings defined in the node operational config, if any

        Else service‑level defaults

        Else platform‑level defaults

No cross‑node inheritance and no site‑wide store. Nodes remain self‑contained and portable.
Build behavior (Weave)

    For each index.html, Weave determines depth (0/1/2) and expands relative paths accordingly—no runtime aliases.

    If a referenced template/asset is missing, fail the build (no silent fallbacks).

    Weave may emit a render manifest (checksums + resolved files) per page to warn on drift across builds. (No write‑blocking.)

Minimal manifest example:

{
  "depth": 2,
  "assets": [{"src":"../../_assets/css/site.css","sha256":"…"}],
  "templates": [{"src":"../_templates/page.njk","sha256":"…"}],
  "resolvedVia": "node",
  "publishedAt": "2025-08-23T19:15:00Z"
}

Template resolution cascade

    Node operational config mapping

    Node _templates/

    Service defaults

    Platform defaults

    Flow pages and snapshot pages both follow this cascade; flows still have exactly one live resource page.

Why this fits

    Works between weaves (pure static relative paths).

    Keeps history coherent (snapshots render with whatever the node currently provides, unless you change those files later—drift can be warned).

    Preserves composability (no external/global stores).

    Keeps authorship expressively similar across node/flow/snapshot pages.

You said:
in terms of node taxonomy. "Bare node", great. "Reference node", anything with a reference flow should be a reference node. Now that data nodes have reference flows, they're really a specific kind of reference node? So maybe we have to call them "dataset reference nodes"?
ChatGPT said:

Yes — you’ve landed on the natural refinement. Let’s work it through carefully:
Current picture

    Bare node → minimal, only _node-metadata-flow + _node-handle.

    Reference node → any node that has a _ref-flow (so you can talk about its referent).

    Data node → you had originally thought of these as “nodes with _data-flow,” but by your newer rule, they must also have _ref-flow.
    → That means every Data node is a Reference node.

Implication

The category “Data node” is not disjoint from “Reference node.” It’s actually a specialization of it.

So the clean taxonomy is:

    Bare node (only metadata)

    Reference node (has _ref-flow)

        Dataset reference node (has _ref-flow + _data-flow)

Why “dataset reference node” works

    Keeps the reference part explicit: you still ground the referent with _ref-flow.

    Narrows it to the dataset domain: what it refers to is specifically an evolvable dataset, which is what the _data-flow manages.

    Consistent naming pattern:

        Reference node → general case

        Dataset reference node → specialized case

Suggested phrasing for the taxonomy doc

        Bare node: minimal node with only metadata.

        Reference node: a node with a _ref-flow, describing its referent.

        Dataset reference node: a reference node that also has a _data-flow. The referent is an evolvable dataset, described in the _ref-flow and materialized in snapshot versions of the _data-flow.

Do you want me to sketch a taxonomy tree diagram (text/ASCII) showing Bare → Reference → Dataset reference, so you can see the nesting visually?
You said:
Sure.
ChatGPT said:

Here’s a compact ASCII taxonomy you can drop into the docs.

summarize recent terminologic/conceptual changes
ChatGPT said:

Here’s a crisp summary of the main terminology & conceptual shifts we’ve worked through over the last few turns:
Node & Referent

    Node IRI = referent identifier (real, abstract, or imaginary).

    Node itself is referenced via its _node-handle (e.g. /djradon/_node-handle).

    Referent’s description lives in the node’s _ref-flow.

    Node’s self-description & policies live in _node-* flows (metadata/config).

Node Taxonomy

    Bare node → only _node-metadata-flow + _node-handle.

    Reference node → any node with a _ref-flow.

    Dataset reference node → a reference node that also has a _data-flow; its referent is an evolvable dataset (snapshotted in versions).

    Removed earlier ambiguity: “Data node” is not a peer to Reference node, but a specialization.

Node-components vs Docs

    Node-components = structural parts of a node (flows, assets, resource pages).

    Doc resources (README, CHANGELOG, _docs/) promoted to a separate category for visibility. They can be contained by nodes or node-components, but are not themselves node-components.

Flows

    Renamed: _meta-flow → _node-metadata-flow (clarity: about the node, not “the node itself”).

    Config split:

        _node-config-operational-flow (runtime/behavioral settings).

        _node-config-inheritable-flow (defaults/policies for descendants).

    Flow pages: each flow has exactly one resource page (always index.html).

    Snapshot pages: version folders (vN/) under flows get their own index.html for history.

Templates & Assets

    Kept node-scoped only (_templates/, _assets/ at node root).

    Resource pages resolve templates/assets based on depth:

        Node page → ./_assets/...

        Flow page → ../_assets/...

        Snapshot page → ../../_assets/...

    Policies (pin/float) simplified away:

        Node-components always depend on the node’s _templates/ and _assets/.

        Resolution cascade: Node config mappings → Node _templates/ → Service defaults → Platform defaults.

    No aliases at runtime: static relative paths only.

    Resource pages must be ready to serve between weaves.

Would you like me to draft this as a living changelog (Markdown, e.g. TERMS-CHANGELOG.md) that you can append to as we refine further?
You said:
what is a good existing RDF property that says "is an abstract dataset"
ChatGPT said:

Good question. In RDF/semantic-web land, there are a couple of ways people do this — but there isn’t a single, canonical property that literally says “is an abstract dataset.” You generally express it via class membership and, if you want, a clarifying property.
1. Use a DCAT class for the abstract dataset

    dcat:Dataset — already defined as “a collection of data, published or curated by a single agent, and available for access or download in one or more representations.”

    dcat:DatasetSeries — explicitly a collection of datasets that form an evolving sequence (e.g., different versions, different snapshots).

        This is the closest fit to your “abstract dataset” notion: a stable identity across versions.

        You’d model the “snapshots” with dcat:Dataset instances linked via dcat:inSeries → dcat:DatasetSeries.

So: mark your referent as a dcat:DatasetSeries if you mean abstract dataset.
2. Existing properties for refinement

If you want a predicate rather than just a class, there are some in DCAT/PROV space:

    dcat:inSeries (dataset → dataset series)

    prov:specializationOf (a more concrete dataset is a specialization of the abstract one)

    dct:isPartOf (looser, but can be used to indicate membership in a higher-level collection/series)

So you could say:

:myDataset dcat:inSeries :myDatasetSeries .
:myDatasetSeries a dcat:DatasetSeries .

3. When you really want a marker property

If you want a boolean-like assertion (“this thing is an abstract dataset”), most practice is to use rdf:type and coin your own class (subclass of dcat:DatasetSeries), e.g.:

:myDatasetSeries a dcat:DatasetSeries, sf:AbstractDataset .

This is clearer than inventing a bespoke property like sf:isAbstractDataset true.

✅ Best practice: use dcat:DatasetSeries as the class of your “abstract dataset” referents, and connect versions/snapshots with dcat:inSeries.

Do you want me to draft a pattern showing how a Dataset reference node in your taxonomy would use dcat:DatasetSeries (abstract referent) vs dcat:Dataset (snapshots)?
You said:
Can you have a datasetseries of one dataset? I want to come up with a mandataory statement for the reference flows of dataset reference nodes. The IRI of the node refers to the dataset. But flows are actually datasetseries. So instead of "<dataset-reference-node-identifier> a dcat:Dataset", should we say it's a dcat:DatasetSeries (even if there's only one version?
ChatGPT said:

Short answer: yes—a dcat:DatasetSeries can validly have one (or even zero) concrete datasets. Nothing in DCAT forbids a singleton series. In your model, that fits perfectly: the node IRI denotes the abstract, evolvable dataset, while concrete snapshots live in the _data-flow and are typed as dcat:Dataset.
Recommendation for Dataset reference node _ref-flow (mandatory core)

Model the node’s referent as the abstract series even if there’s only one version:

@prefix dcat: <http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#> .
@prefix dct:  <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix prov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#> .
@prefix xsd:  <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

# The node IRI identifies the abstract/evolvable dataset (the series)
<https://ns.example.org/projects/atlas/>
    a dcat:DatasetSeries ;
    rdfs:label "Atlas dataset" ;
    dct:creator <https://ns.example.org/agents/weave> ;
    dct:created "2025-08-24T00:00:00Z"^^xsd:dateTime .

When a first snapshot exists (linkage pattern)

Your _data-flow/v1/… snapshot gets its own IRI and links to the series:

# One concrete snapshot/version
<https://ns.example.org/projects/atlas/_data-flow/v1/>
    a dcat:Dataset ;
    dcat:inSeries <https://ns.example.org/projects/atlas/> ;
    dct:isVersionOf <https://ns.example.org/projects/atlas/> ;
    rdfs:label "Atlas dataset v1" ;
    prov:wasGeneratedBy <https://ns.example.org/proc/build-1234> .

(You can add your preferred “current” pointer if you keep one—e.g., pav:hasCurrentVersion—but it’s optional.)
Why type the node as dcat:DatasetSeries?

    Keeps the clean abstract vs concrete separation your taxonomy uses.

    Avoids retyping the node across releases (the series is stable; snapshots come and go).

    Allows singleton gracefully; if you never add a v2, the series-of-one is still coherent.

Minimal mandatory fields I’d require in the _ref-flow for dataset reference nodes

    rdf:type dcat:DatasetSeries

    A human label: rdfs:label (or dct:title)

    Basic provenance about the series: at least one of dct:creator, prov:wasAttributedTo, and a timestamp (dct:created)

That’s it—you’ve got a stable, future‑proof statement that works for one version or many.
You said:
So should we call the nodes "Dataset Series Reference Nodes"? -- that's a mouthful. But we can call them "data nodes" for short maybe.
ChatGPT said:

Yeah, I’d frame it like this:
Formal term (precise, unambiguous)

    Dataset Series Reference Node

        Definition: a node whose referent is a dcat:DatasetSeries, described in its _ref-flow.

        Its _data-flow contains the snapshots (dcat:Dataset) that belong to that series.

Short/common term (friendly, everyday use)

    Data node

        Acceptable shorthand in docs, code, and conversations.

        Just be clear early on that “data node” = “Dataset Series Reference Node.”

Why this works

    You get terminological precision in formal ontology/taxonomy: no ambiguity that the referent is the series, not a single dataset.

    You keep usability with a short term: “data node” is approachable and intuitive.

    The mapping is one-to-one: every “data node” is formally a Dataset Series Reference Node.

✅ Suggestion: In your taxonomy doc, define it once like this:

    Dataset Series Reference Node (short: Data node)
    A reference node whose referent is a dcat:DatasetSeries. Its _ref-flow declares the abstract dataset series, and its _data-flow contains versioned snapshots (dcat:Dataset).

Do you want me to re-draw the taxonomy tree (Bare → Reference → Dataset Series Reference [Data]) with both formal and short names side-by-side?
You said:
Or we could also just call them "Dataset Reference Nodes", and then in documentation, talk about how they're specifically DatasetSeries reference nodes.
ChatGPT said:

That’s a smart middle ground. 👍

    Dataset Reference Node → short, approachable, works well in everyday docs and diagrams.

    In formal description, clarify:

    A Dataset Reference Node is a reference node whose referent is modeled as a dcat:DatasetSeries. This means the node IRI identifies the abstract/evolvable dataset, even if there is only one snapshot.

That way:

    The name is short and natural.

    You don’t burden readers with “Series” every time.

    But the precision is still captured in the definition — no ambiguity for people who care about the RDF semantics.

Revised taxonomy tree

Mesh Node Taxonomy
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Node
  • required: _node-metadata-flow, _node-handle
  • extends namespace
  • contains nodes, node-components, doc resources

└── Bare Node
    • only required facets (no _ref-flow, no _data-flow)

└── Reference Node
    • has _ref-flow (describes referent)

    └── Dataset Reference Node
        • referent modeled as dcat:DatasetSeries
        • has _ref-flow (DatasetSeries) + _data-flow (snapshots as dcat:Dataset)

So your doc prose can say something like:

    Dataset Reference Nodes (formally, DatasetSeries reference nodes) are reference nodes whose referent is an evolvable dataset. In RDF terms, the node IRI identifies a dcat:DatasetSeries.

Would you like me to draft a canonical RDF pattern snippet for the _ref-flow of a Dataset Reference Node (so you can drop it into the docs as “all dataset reference nodes must at least say …”)?
You said:
is it "reference node whose referent is modeled as a" or "reference node whose referent is a"
ChatGPT said:

Good catch — that distinction matters.

    “Modeled as a” → hedges a bit. It implies we are choosing to treat the referent as a dcat:DatasetSeries, but maybe in some other ontology it could be something else.

    “Is a” → stronger, cleaner, and matches how RDF/OWL is normally phrased (rdf:type says is a).

Since in your system the node IRI is defined to identify the dataset series (even singleton), I’d go with:

    A Dataset Reference Node is a reference node whose referent is a dcat:DatasetSeries.

That keeps the definition crisp and aligns with the mandatory _ref-flow typing you’re planning.

Would you like me to also suggest minimal mandatory triples for all Dataset Reference Node _ref-flows, so “is a dcat:DatasetSeries” isn’t just prose but a concrete rule?
You said:
So a "data node" is a dataset series, and it contains a "data flow" which is also a datasetseries. Hmmm. And then, no problem with the data flow's snapshots being datasets, with their distributions. But the dual DatasetSeries thing seem slightly awkward, probably needs explication.
ChatGPT said:

Yes — you’ve pinpointed the subtlety: you end up with two DatasetSeries in play when you talk about a “data node.”
1. The outer DatasetSeries = the node’s referent

    The node’s IRI is a dcat:DatasetSeries.

    This expresses: “There is an abstract, evolvable dataset called Atlas.”

    Mandatory statement in _ref-flow:

    <…/projects/atlas/> a dcat:DatasetSeries .

2. The inner DatasetSeries = the node’s _data-flow

    _data-flow itself is also a dcat:DatasetSeries.

    This expresses: “Here is the series of concrete dataset snapshots for Atlas.”

    Example:

    <…/projects/atlas/_data-flow/> a dcat:DatasetSeries ;
        dcat:inSeries <…/projects/atlas/> .

So the _data-flow series is the implementation series that carries snapshots.
The node series is the abstract series, giving the dataset its identity in the mesh.
3. The snapshots = concrete datasets

    Each _data-flow/vN/ is a dcat:Dataset.

    Each dcat:Dataset links back to the _data-flow series (and optionally to the node series):

    <…/projects/atlas/_data-flow/v1/> a dcat:Dataset ;
        dcat:inSeries <…/projects/atlas/_data-flow/> ;
        dct:isVersionOf <…/projects/atlas/> .

4. Why the “dual series” isn’t as bad as it sounds

    Node’s series = stable referent (the thing people cite).

    Flow’s series = concrete evolution mechanism (the snapshots you actually query/download).

    The separation allows:

        Node metadata & identity to remain stable even if flows are reorganized.

        One node to potentially have multiple flows (data, ref, config) each with its own series of versions.

        Uniform handling of flows (they’re all series), without breaking the convention that nodes are also series.

It does need explication in docs, but once you draw it out, the pattern is consistent:

    Every node is a series (of itself across time).

    Every flow is a series (of its snapshots across time).

    Every snapshot is a dataset (with distributions).

👉 Do you want me to sketch a little three-level diagram (Node series → Flow series → Dataset snapshots) so you can put it straight into your doc as the “explication” for this duality?
You said:
I think I want to introduce the abstract concept of a "mesh identifier", which can be either a URL (IRI) or an intramesh identifier. But I'm concerned about whether intramesh identifiers are really different from whatever you call RDF identifiers without the scheme. What do you call them?

Initially I though the difference would be disallowing # and ?, but I do want to use fragment identifiers more... but not to solve httprange14 -- only for minting IRIs for things that don't justify having their own node. My canonical example is the steps in a delegation chain. #step1, #step2, etc. They function kind of like blank nodes, in that they're a convenient way to mint an IRI without creating a new node. They are still dereferenceable because the resource page for their containing node can have a section name that corresponds.
ChatGPT said:

This is a neat distinction you’re circling around — and it’s good to be precise. Let me unpack the terminology and then suggest how to carve out mesh identifier cleanly.
1. What RDF calls these things

    IRI: the full superset (Unicode + schemes, per RFC 3987).

    URI: legacy term; in RDF, IRIs are preferred.

    Relative IRIs: allowed in Turtle, JSON-LD, etc.; resolved against a @base.

    Fragment identifiers (#foo): always allowed; semantically they identify a secondary resource within the IRI’s referent. RDF treats them as perfectly valid IRIs.

    Blank nodes: non-IRIs, exist only in a given RDF graph, can’t be referenced outside.

So, RDF doesn’t really have a named category for “identifiers without scheme” — they’re just relative IRIs.
2. Your “mesh identifier”

From how you describe it:

    Can be a full URL/IRI (e.g., https://ns.example.org/foo/bar/).

    Or can be a relative IRI scoped to the mesh (e.g., <djradon/_node-handle>).

    You want to allow fragment forms (#step1) as lightweight minted identifiers for sub-resources that don’t justify a whole node.

So a mesh identifier = {IRI | intramesh identifier}, where intramesh identifier = relative IRI that gets resolved within the mesh context.
3. Are intramesh identifiers really distinct?

In pure RDF terms: no — they’re just relative IRIs, resolved against @base.
But in Semantic Flow terms, yes — because you’re enforcing conventions:

    They always resolve within the mesh (not arbitrary base).

    They can include fragments (#…) but you’re making it explicit that this is not about HTTPRange-14, just sub-referents inside the node’s page.

    They’re dereferenceable because the resource page at the node root can expose anchors or sections matching those fragments.

That’s what makes them mesh identifiers — constrained relative IRIs, scoped and dereferenceable in the mesh.
4. Canonical example (delegation chain steps)

    Node IRI: https://ns.example.org/delegation/

    Intramesh minted identifiers:

        <#step1>

        <#step2>

        <#step3>

These don’t become new nodes — they’re identifiers for sub-resources of the delegation node. The node’s resource page can render them as anchors (id="step1", etc.), so dereferencing still works.
They’re like a middle ground: lighter than minting a node, more stable than a blank node.
5. Suggested definition for your docs

    Mesh Identifier
    A mesh identifier is the identifier of any resource in a mesh. It can be:

        a full IRI (usually an HTTP(S) URL), or

        an intramesh identifier, a relative IRI resolved within the mesh.

    Intramesh identifiers may include fragment identifiers (e.g., #step1), which are used for lightweight sub-resources that do not warrant their own node. Unlike blank nodes, these identifiers are dereferenceable: the containing node’s resource page can provide anchors or sections that correspond to them.

✅ This way you get a clean, abstract notion (“mesh identifier”), with intramesh identifiers as a convention-governed subclass of relative IRIs.

Would you like me to also sketch naming rules/constraints for intramesh identifiers (e.g., no ?, reserved _ prefix rules, etc.), to lock down their syntax?
You said:
can't you have relative IRIs that include the scheme? Something like https://.../../test? Maybe not. But also you can have "absolute IRIs", without a scheme, just </ns/djradon>. how do you differentiate those?

ChatGPT said:

You’re right to pause here — the terminology in the IRI/URI specs can get pretty slippery. Let me disentangle:
1. Absolute vs. Relative IRI (per RFC 3987 / RDF specs)

    Absolute IRI

        Must include a scheme (http:, https:, urn:, etc.).

        Example:

    https://ns.example.org/djradon
    urn:uuid:550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000

    No ambiguity: it’s globally scoped.

Relative IRI

    Lacks a scheme → must be resolved against a base IRI.

    Examples:

        djradon/_node-handle
        ../foo/bar
        #step1

        These are what Turtle, JSON-LD, etc. let you write inside <…> brackets.

2. Your examples

    https://.../../test
    → This does have a scheme (https:), so it’s an absolute IRI.
    → The ../ is just a path segment inside the absolute IRI, not a “relative” climb.
    → When parsed, it normalizes to a canonical absolute form (https://.../test).

    </ns/djradon>
    → No scheme. RDF libraries will parse this as a relative IRI with a leading slash in its path.
    → It’s not “absolute” in the formal sense, because “absolute” = must have scheme.
    → This is actually called a network-path reference or “scheme-relative” form in URL/IRI terminology, but in RDF land it’s treated as relative (resolved against base).

3. How to talk about them clearly

    Absolute IRI = has scheme.

    Relative IRI = no scheme, requires base.

        Subtypes:

            path-relative: foo/bar, ../baz

            root-relative: /ns/djradon (starts with /, but still resolved against base)

            fragment-only: #step1

So <djradon/_node-handle> and </ns/djradon> are both relative IRIs. The second one just looks “absolute-ish” because of the leading /, but formally it’s still relative.
4. Where “mesh identifiers” fit

    Mesh identifier =

        an absolute IRI (usual case, e.g. https://ns.example.org/foo/), OR

        an intramesh identifier (a relative IRI, which could be path-relative, root-relative, or fragment form).

By calling them “intramesh identifiers,” you get to impose your own scoping and dereferenceability rules, regardless of whether they’re path-relative (djradon/_node-handle) or root-relative (/ns/djradon).

✅ So the differentiation you were reaching for is:

    Absolute IRI (has a scheme)

    Relative IRI (no scheme)

        may look like /ns/djradon, but still relative

Would you like me to sketch a mini table for your docs, showing each form (absolute, path-relative, root-relative, fragment) with how it resolves in the mesh?
You said:
which RDF syntaxes do not support relative IRIs.
ChatGPT said:

Good, crisp question. In RDF land, most modern syntaxes allow relative IRIs, but not all. The dividing line is usually:

    syntaxes designed for exchange and readability → yes, relative IRIs (resolved against a base).

    syntaxes designed for canonical serialization / streaming → no, only absolute IRIs.

RDF syntaxes that support relative IRIs

    Turtle (and its predecessor N-Triples*, see below)

    TriG

    N3 (Notation3)

    JSON-LD (via @base)

    RDFa (in HTML, via document base IRI)

    RDF/XML (via xml:base)

(*N-Triples used to forbid relative IRIs; see below.)
RDF syntaxes that do NOT support relative IRIs

    Canonical N-Triples (W3C 2014 / RDF 1.1 N-Triples):

        “IRIs must be absolute; relative IRIs are not permitted.”

    N-Quads: same restriction as N-Triples — absolute IRIs only.

    RDF/JSON (the old unofficial format): in practice only absolute IRIs.

    Canonical RDF syntaxes used for signing/canonicalization (like RDF Dataset Normalization / URDNA2015): absolute only.

Why

    Turtle, JSON-LD, RDF/XML → designed for humans, benefit from @base shorthand.

    N-Triples / N-Quads → designed for machine processing, canonicalization, streaming; no @base, only absolute IRIs allowed.

✅ Summary

    Allow relative IRIs: Turtle, TriG, N3, JSON-LD, RDFa, RDF/XML.

    Require absolute IRIs: N-Triples, N-Quads, canonicalization syntaxes.

Would you like me to also suggest a best-practice note for Semantic Flow? (e.g., “Prefer intramesh identifiers in Turtle/Trig for authoring, but normalize to absolute IRIs in N-Quads/N-Triples distributions.”)
You said:
What do you mean by "They always resolve within the mesh (not arbitrary base)."
ChatGPT said:

Right — let me unpack what I meant there, because it may have sounded slippery.
1. In vanilla RDF

    A relative IRI is always resolved against a base IRI.

    That base can be arbitrary:

        @base directive in Turtle/Trig

        xml:base in RDF/XML

        document URL in RDFa/JSON-LD (if no explicit base)

So if you write <foo/bar> without setting @base, you can’t predict how it resolves — it depends on the parser’s base.
2. In a mesh

What I was getting at: in your Semantic Flow mesh, you’re constraining the rules for relative IRIs.

    Intramesh identifiers (<djradon/_node-handle>, <#step1>) are always resolved relative to the mesh structure, not to some arbitrary document URL or @base.

    In other words, the “base” isn’t external; it’s the mesh’s namespace root (or the node root, depending on the identifier style).

    That’s what makes them special compared to vanilla relative IRIs.

So when I wrote “not arbitrary base,” I meant:
👉 In Semantic Flow, you fix the base semantics to the mesh context, so relative IRIs are portable and predictable. They won’t suddenly mean something else if the file is moved or parsed with a different base IRI.
3. Practical consequence

    In Turtle:

    @base <https://ns.example.org/> .
    <djradon/_node-handle> a sf:NodeHandle .

    In Semantic Flow docs, you can treat <djradon/_node-handle> as a mesh identifier, guaranteed to expand to https://ns.example.org/djradon/_node-handle.

    No risk that it accidentally becomes file:///home/user/project/djradon/_node-handle just because someone loaded the file locally without a base.

✅ So: “always resolve within the mesh” = intramesh identifiers are constrained to expand relative to the mesh’s namespace root, not whatever ambient base the RDF parser happens to be using.

Would it help if I drafted a one-paragraph definition of “intramesh identifier” for your docs, emphasizing this distinction from ordinary relative IRIs?
You said:
Still thinking about whether the identifier for a data node is referencing a dataset or a dataset series. I feel like there's an argument to be made that it is referencing a dataset. Unless the particular dataset it's referencing is actually a datasetseries. 
ChatGPT said:

Yes — this is the crux, and I see why you keep circling it. Let’s tease the distinction carefully:
DCAT’s language

    dcat:Dataset = “a collection of data, published or curated by a single agent, and available for access or download in one or more representations.”

        This is a concrete dataset in the sense that it can have distributions.

    dcat:DatasetSeries = “a collection of datasets that are published separately, but share a common focus and are grouped together.”

        This is a series container for multiple datasets.

In your mesh framing

    A data node is holonic:

        It has its own identity (the node’s IRI).

        It contains a _data-flow, which itself has snapshots (v1/, v2/, …).

    So: what is the referent of the node IRI?

Two possible readings:

    Node IRI refers to a Dataset

        Argument: From a user’s perspective, “Atlas dataset” is a dataset.

        The _data-flow snapshots are versions of that dataset (dcat:Dataset again).

        You’d need a property like dct:isVersionOf or pav:hasCurrentVersion to link them back.

        Slight awkwardness: dataset vs dataset version start to collapse together.

    Node IRI refers to a DatasetSeries

        Argument: Because it explicitly contains evolving snapshots, its identity is really that of a series.

        The _data-flow is the mechanism that manifests the series as concrete datasets.

        This matches DCAT’s dcat:DatasetSeries semantics directly.

        Slight awkwardness: “Atlas dataset” sounds like a dataset, not a series.

Hybrid perspective (your “unless” intuition)

You could make the rule:

    By default, a data node referent is a dcat:Dataset.

    But if the node has an explicit _data-flow with multiple snapshots, then its referent is best typed as a dcat:DatasetSeries.

That gives you a graceful “promotion path”:

    Start life as a dcat:Dataset.

    If/when it evolves into a versioned series, assert a dcat:DatasetSeries in the _ref-flow.

My take

If your goal is clean semantics and consistency, it’s less confusing to always type the node referent as a dcat:DatasetSeries — even if it currently has one snapshot. That way you don’t change the type later when it evolves. DCAT itself allows a series of one.

But if your goal is natural language alignment (“Atlas dataset is a dataset”), then the promotion model might feel better — but you’ll need to handle type churn (Dataset → DatasetSeries) and migration in your tooling.

👉 Do you want me to sketch out the mandatory _ref-flow triple(s) for both interpretations (“always series” vs. “promotion model”), so you can see how they look side by side?
You said:
The _data-flow is clearly a datasetseries, like all flows. Saying the data node's referent is a dataset doesn't have so much to do with whether there is more than one version in the flow. It's about calling something a dataset when conceptually it is a dataset. Since a datasetseries is also a dataset, I think it's okay to just call even a datasetseries dataset a dataset. 

it's hard to describe, but it feels like a flow is a datasetseries but the referent of a data node is just a dataset.
ChatGPT said:

Yes — you’ve hit on the subtle but actually quite clean distinction:
1. Flows are always DatasetSeries

That’s by construction in your mesh:

    A flow = an evolving sequence of snapshots.

    Therefore, a _data-flow (like _ref-flow or _config-flow) is always a dcat:DatasetSeries.

    The snapshots inside it are dcat:Dataset instances.

This is unambiguous: flows = series.
2. Data node referent = a Dataset

The referent of the node itself feels conceptually different:

    To humans, the node is the dataset (Atlas dataset, Sensor42 dataset, etc.).

    The fact that it can evolve doesn’t stop it being “a dataset” in the ordinary sense.

    And in DCAT terms: a dcat:DatasetSeries is itself a subclass of dcat:Dataset.

        So calling the referent a dcat:Dataset is correct and doesn’t preclude it from also being a dcat:DatasetSeries.

This is why it feels okay to just say “the node is a dataset” — you’re leaning on the subclass relationship.
3. How to word it cleanly

        Every flow is a dcat:DatasetSeries.

        A data node’s referent is a dcat:Dataset.

            In practice, because it has a _data-flow, it may also be typed as a dcat:DatasetSeries.

            But it’s natural to speak of it as a dataset, since DatasetSeries ⊆ Dataset.

4. Example in Turtle

@prefix dcat: <http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#> .
@prefix dct:  <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .

# The node referent (Atlas dataset)
<https://ns.example.org/projects/atlas/>
    a dcat:Dataset ;          # core identity (it *is a dataset*)
    a dcat:DatasetSeries ;    # optionally, acknowledge evolvability
    dct:title "Atlas dataset" .

# The flow (evolvable series of snapshots)
<https://ns.example.org/projects/atlas/_data-flow/>
    a dcat:DatasetSeries ;
    dcat:inSeries <https://ns.example.org/projects/atlas/> .

# One snapshot
<https://ns.example.org/projects/atlas/_data-flow/v1/>
    a dcat:Dataset ;
    dcat:inSeries <https://ns.example.org/projects/atlas/_data-flow/> ;
    dct:isVersionOf <https://ns.example.org/projects/atlas/> .

5. Takeaway

    Flows: always DatasetSeries.

    Data node referents: naturally Dataset, optionally also DatasetSeries.

    Since DatasetSeries is a subclass of Dataset, calling the node simply “a dataset” is both conceptually right and ontologically sound.

Would you like me to draft a short canonical rule for your docs along the lines of:

    “Every data node is a dataset; its _data-flow is a dataset series; and the snapshots inside that flow are datasets with distributions”?

You said:
Regarding "“the node is a dataset”" -- the node isn't a dataset, the node refers to and contains a dataset.
ChatGPT said:

Ah, yes — thank you for slowing me down. You’re right: in your mesh semantics, a node is never “the thing” itself. It’s always the container that:

    refers to something (the referent, via _ref-flow), and

    contains flows that describe/manifest aspects of that referent.

So when we talk about data nodes:

    The node itself = a mesh construct (identified via _node-handle, with _node-metadata-flow).

    The referent of the node = a dataset (in DCAT terms, a dcat:Dataset).

    The _data-flow inside the node = a dcat:DatasetSeries (the evolving sequence of snapshots).

    The snapshots inside the _data-flow = dcat:Dataset instances (each with its own distributions).

Restated cleanly

    A data node is a mesh node whose referent is a dataset.

        The node’s _ref-flow asserts the dataset identity (usually a dcat:Dataset).

        Its _data-flow is a dcat:DatasetSeries representing how that dataset evolves over time.

        Each snapshot within the _data-flow is itself a dcat:Dataset with concrete distributions.

Example (Turtle)

@prefix dcat: <http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#> .

✅ This way you don’t collapse “node” and “dataset.” Instead, you stay consistent: nodes contain & point to things; referents are the things.

Would you like me to rewrite the taxonomy note for “Dataset Reference Node” in this stricter “node vs. referent” language so it’s airtight?
