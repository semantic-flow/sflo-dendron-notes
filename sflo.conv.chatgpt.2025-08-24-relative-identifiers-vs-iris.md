I've been using the concept, "relative identifiers":


Relative identifiers are like URLs (or URIs), but without the scheme (i.e., https:// or file://). They correspond to the filesystem location of their corresponding resources. Relative identifiers are recorded within distributions and, where configuration is needed, under the node‚Äôs operational config flow. Paths are always resolved relative to the distribution file that declares them.

If it starts with a ../ it refers to the parent, ../../ refers to the grandparent, etc.

## Identifier Semantics

Identifiers have the same semantics as [[concept.url]]

## Identifier Name Limitations

- initial underscores prefix all reserved dataset identifiers and should be avoided in general
![[sflo#^pnoqpr3ff4za]] 

## Examples

Directory structure: node/flow/snapshot/distribution.trig

Operational config example: my-dataset/_config-operational-flow/_current/config.trig  
Inheritable config example: my-dataset/_config-inheritable-flow/_current/config.trig  
Meta-flow example: my-dataset/_meta-flow/_current/meta.trig

Relative identifiers from meta-flow distributions:

Node self-reference: "../../my-dataset"  
Other flows: "../../_config-operational-flow/_current/config.trig", "../../_config-inheritable-flow/_current/config.trig", "../../_data-flow/_current/data.jsonld"  
Elements in other flows: Same pattern, just different flow names

---

BUT... I think they're the same thing as "base-relative IRIs". Is there a better term? Are they the same?
ChatGPT said:
You‚Äôre right to notice that what you‚Äôve been calling relative identifiers overlap heavily with the established notion of relative IRIs (from RFC 3987, Internationalized Resource Identifiers) and base-relative resolution (from RFC 3986, URIs).

Let me tease them apart:

1. Relative Identifiers (your definition)
Always file-path‚Äìlike.

Explicitly omit scheme (https://, file://, etc.).

Always resolved relative to the distribution file in which they appear.

Examples: ../../my-dataset, ../config.trig.

This makes them essentially pathnames within a virtual filesystem that overlays the namespace.

2. Relative IRIs (standard)
Defined in RFC 3987, and relative resolution is defined in RFC 3986.

Any IRI reference that does not include a scheme can be relative (e.g., "foo", "../bar", "?x=1", "#frag").

They are resolved against a base IRI, which may be a document IRI (e.g., an RDF distribution file), an xml:base, a JSON-LD @base, or another declared base.

Examples: ../bar, ?query=1, #frag.

So in RDF terms, ../../my-dataset is already a perfectly valid relative IRI that, when combined with the file‚Äôs base, resolves to an absolute IRI.

3. Key Differences
Scope restriction: You‚Äôre limiting relative identifiers to path-like references (no query, fragment, etc.), whereas RFC relative IRIs allow those.

Terminology: You‚Äôre intentionally avoiding calling them ‚ÄúIRIs‚Äù because you want to emphasize they‚Äôre filesystem-rooted rather than abstract web identifiers.

Semantics: In RDF, relative IRIs are about resolving to absolute IRIs. In your system, relative identifiers are more like a convention for expressing intra-site links within Semantic Flow.

4. Better Terminology?
If you want to stay aligned with web standards but still signal the narrower scope, some possible terms:

Path-relative IRIs ‚Äì emphasizes you‚Äôre restricting to path segments.

Base-relative IRIs ‚Äì standard-compatible and accurate (relative to the distribution‚Äôs base).

Relative paths ‚Äì simplest, but risks confusion with plain filesystem paths.

Mesh-relative IRIs ‚Äì project-specific, makes sense if you want to emphasize they resolve inside your mesh.

Local identifiers ‚Äì common in RDF circles (though sometimes used for blank node IDs).

‚úÖ My recommendation:
If you want to be interoperable with RDF standards, call them relative IRIs (or even path-relative IRIs). That way readers don‚Äôt think you‚Äôve invented a new category of identifier; they‚Äôll recognize it as a subset of what RDF already allows.

If you want a project-specific term to emphasize your convention, mesh-relative IRIs might be nice ‚Äî because they‚Äôre relative within your Semantic Flow mesh.

Do you want me to sketch out how your ‚Äúrelative identifiers‚Äù map precisely onto RFC relative IRIs with examples of edge cases (like fragments and queries)? That might help decide whether you want to restrict the term or adopt the standard wholesale.

You said:
But I think I can just use base-relative IRIs. They could include fragments. Since my filesystem corresponds directly to IRIs, they are effectively the same. If you agree, please rewrite the description
ChatGPT said:
Got it üëç ‚Äî yes, if your filesystem layout corresponds directly to IRIs, then what you‚Äôve been calling ‚Äúrelative identifiers‚Äù are just base-relative IRIs. That keeps you aligned with RDF/Web standards while still describing the behavior you want (resolution relative to the distribution file).

Here‚Äôs a rewritten version of your description, streamlined to reflect that:

Base-Relative IRIs
Base-relative IRIs are IRIs written in relative form, resolved against the base IRI of the distribution file in which they appear. In Semantic Flow, the filesystem path of a distribution corresponds directly to its IRI, so filesystem-style relative paths can be used to link across datasets, flows, and elements.

If an IRI starts with ../, it refers to the parent folder; ../../ refers to the grandparent, and so on.

Fragments (#‚Ä¶) and queries (?‚Ä¶) may be used as in any IRI.

Resolution always occurs relative to the base IRI of the distribution file (typically its on-disk location).

Identifier Semantics
Base-relative IRIs have the same semantics as [[concept.url]].

Naming Limitations
Initial underscores are reserved for system dataset identifiers (e.g., _config-flow, _meta-flow). To avoid collisions, user-minted identifiers should not begin with _.

Examples
Directory structure:
node/flow/snapshot/distribution.trig

Operational config example:
my-dataset/_config-operational-flow/_current/config.trig

Inheritable config example:
my-dataset/_config-inheritable-flow/_current/config.trig

Meta-flow example:
my-dataset/_meta-flow/_current/meta.trig

Base-relative IRIs within a meta-flow distribution:

Node self-reference: "../../my-dataset"

Other flows:

"../../_config-operational-flow/_current/config.trig"

"../../_config-inheritable-flow/_current/config.trig"

"../../_data-flow/_current/data.jsonld"

Elements in other flows: same pattern, using the corresponding flow name.

With fragments: "../../_data-flow/_current/data.jsonld#SomeElement"

Would you like me to also phrase this so that it explicitly says ‚Äúthis is just standard relative IRI resolution (RFC 3986/3987)‚Äù ‚Äî so readers know it‚Äôs not a custom rule ‚Äî or keep the language project-specific?

You said:
Hmm... this actually uncovers a serious issue. I was thinking about just avoiding base specification, in which case the client is supposed to assume that the request URL is the base (minus the file portion). Right? 

But since my distributions are buried, e.g. djradon/_data-flow/current/djradon.trig, to refer to djradon I would have to do ../.. or ../../../djradon as my base-relative IRIs. :/
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 17s
You‚Äôre right on both counts:

By default, the base IRI = the retrieval IRI of the document (the request URL, including its path).

If you don‚Äôt explicitly set a base, anything higher up the tree requires ../ hops‚Äîpainful for buried distributions.

The clean fix is to declare a base inside each distribution to ‚Äúpin‚Äù resolution at the node root (or at the namespace root), so your links don‚Äôt depend on how deep the file sits.

Here are solid, standards‚Äëaligned options:

Option A: Set base to the node root
This keeps all intra‚Äënode links short and stable.

TriG/Turtle
@base <../../> .
# Now <> is the node IRI (‚Äúdjradon/‚Äù)
<> a :Thing ;
   :hasMeta <_meta-flow/_current/meta.trig> ;
   :hasData <_data-flow/_current/djradon.jsonld> ;
   :self <> .
JSON‚ÄëLD (in the @context)
{
  "@context": {
    "@base": "../../"
  },
  "@id": "",                // "" (or "<>") refers to the base IRI set above
  "@type": "Thing",
  "hasMeta": "_meta-flow/_current/meta.trig",
  "hasData": "_data-flow/_current/djradon.jsonld"
}
Notes:

In Turtle/TriG, <> denotes ‚Äúthe base IRI‚Äù. With @base <../../>, <> is the node.

In JSON‚ÄëLD, @id: "" resolves to the base too (same effect as <> in Turtle).

Option B: Set base to the namespace root
If you want fully namespace‚Äëanchored references that don‚Äôt change even if the node moves.

TriG/Turtle
@base <https://example.org/ns/> .
<djradon> a :Thing ;
  :hasMeta <djradon/_meta-flow/_current/meta.trig> .
JSON‚ÄëLD
{
  "@context": {
    "@base": "https://example.org/ns/"
  },
  "@id": "djradon",
  "hasMeta": "djradon/_meta-flow/_current/meta.trig"
}
Option C: Use a prefix bound to the node root
Handy if you prefer CURIE‚Äëstyle without changing the document base.

TriG/Turtle
@prefix node: <../../> .
node:  a :Thing ;
       :hasData node:_data-flow/_current/djradon.jsonld .
(Works, but Option A is simpler and makes <> useful.)

Recommendation
For your case (djradon/_data-flow/_current/djradon.trig wanting to refer to djradon/), use Option A: set @base <../../> (or @base "../../" in JSON‚ÄëLD).

Then use <> / "" for the node itself and short, path‚Äëlike IRIs for flows (_meta-flow/..., _config-operational-flow/..., etc.).

This decouples content from nesting depth and avoids brittle ../../../ chains.

If you want, I can also rewrite your ‚ÄúBase‚ÄëRelative IRIs‚Äù section to prescribe ‚Äúdeclare @base to the node root in every distribution,‚Äù with compact examples for TriG and JSON‚ÄëLD.

You said:
I agree, I think A holds more promise. In your example would you set @base to <../../../> ? i.e., it's from _current, so ../ is _data-flow, ../../ is djradon and to refer to <djradon> you'd have to do ../../..
ChatGPT said:
Ah, this is where the subtleties matter. Let‚Äôs walk it carefully with your example path:

djradon/_data-flow/_current/djradon.trig
If no explicit @base
The default base is the document IRI:

‚Ä¶/djradon/_data-flow/_current/djradon.trig
To get to the node root (‚Ä¶/djradon/), you‚Äôd indeed need
../../.. (‚Üí _current/ ‚Üí _data-flow/ ‚Üí djradon/).
That‚Äôs the ‚Äúugh, too many dot-dots‚Äù version.

If you set @base <../../>
Resolution happens relative to the document‚Äôs own path.

Start: ‚Ä¶/djradon/_data-flow/_current/ (because relative resolution drops the filename).

Apply ../../ ‚Üí

_current/ ‚Üí _data-flow/ ‚Üí

‚Üí djradon/. ‚úÖ

So @base <../../> makes the base the node root.
From that base:

<> or "" = ‚Ä¶/djradon/ (node IRI)

_meta-flow/_current/meta.trig = ‚Ä¶/djradon/_meta-flow/_current/meta.trig

_config-operational-flow/_current/config.trig = ‚Ä¶/djradon/_config-operational-flow/_current/config.trig

If you instead set @base <../../../>
Start: ‚Ä¶/djradon/_data-flow/_current/

Apply ../../../ ‚Üí up to ‚Ä¶/ (the namespace root, not the node).

Then <> would be the namespace, and you‚Äôd need to say djradon explicitly to get the node.

That‚Äôs still valid, but it‚Äôs Option B (namespace-anchored).

‚úÖ So to answer your question:
If your goal is Option A (node-root anchoring), then you want:

@base <../../> .
not <../../../>.

Do you want me to rewrite your Base-Relative IRIs section so it mandates that each distribution sets @base <../../> (to normalize on node-root)? That way authors never have to count ../.. chains again.

You said:
I agree, with ../../ then <> = djradon, but if you wanted <djradon> then you'd have to do ../../../
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 11s
Tiny correction here:

With @base <../../> (node-root anchoring), <> is the node itself (‚Ä¶/djradon/).
But <djradon> would NOT be the node‚Äîit would resolve to a child of the node: ‚Ä¶/djradon/djradon.

So you don‚Äôt want <djradon> in that setup. Use <> for the node.

If you occasionally need namespace-root‚Äìanchored references (e.g., to other sibling nodes), you‚Äôve got two clean patterns:

Keep @base <../../> (node root) and add a namespace prefix

@base   <../../> .
@prefix ns: <../../../> .   # one level higher = namespace root

<> a :Thing ;
   :sameAs ns:djradon ;           # namespace-root/djradon
   :seeAlso ns:another-node .     # namespace-root/another-node
Or set @base <../../../> (namespace root) when you need it

@base <../../../> .
<djradon> a :Thing ;              # namespace-root/djradon
<another-node> a :Thing .
Quick mental model:

Base you set	<> resolves to‚Ä¶	<djradon> resolves to‚Ä¶
@base <../../>	‚Ä¶/djradon/ (the node)	‚Ä¶/djradon/djradon (child of node)
@base <../../../>	‚Ä¶/ (namespace root)	‚Ä¶/djradon (the node at namespace root)
Most of the time, stick with node-root base (../../) and use <> for self; add a ns: prefix when you need to point at siblings from the namespace root.

You said:
I'm thinking it's better to refer to <djradon> than <>. It has the nice property of being able to refer to djradon's siblings, which for _data-flow data would be more common than refering to the mesh elements within djradon.
ChatGPT said:
Yes ‚Äî that‚Äôs a really good instinct.

Here‚Äôs the tradeoff restated:

@base <../../> (node-root anchoring)
<> = the node (‚Ä¶/djradon/)

djradon = ‚Ä¶/djradon/djradon (child, almost never what you want)

Good when you mostly talk inside the node (its flows, elements).

@base <../../../> (namespace-root anchoring)
<> = the namespace root (‚Ä¶/)

djradon = the node itself (‚Ä¶/djradon)

other-sibling = a sibling node (‚Ä¶/other-sibling)

Good when you mostly talk across nodes (siblings in the namespace).

Since your _data-flow distributions usually reference siblings more often than mesh elements inside the node, anchoring at the namespace root is cleaner:

@base <../../../> .

<djradon> a :Node ;
  :seeAlso <another-node> ;
  :imports <third-node/_meta-flow/_current/meta.trig> .
That way:

<> = namespace (rarely needed explicitly).

<djradon> is the current node.

<another-node> is a sibling.

Paths like <third-node/_meta-flow/_current/meta.trig> work naturally.

‚úÖ So I agree: for flow data (like _data-flow), it‚Äôs more natural to use @base <../../../> so you can use <djradon> (and siblings) directly.

üëâ One hybrid possibility:

Use namespace-root base (../../../) for _data-flow and _ref-flow distributions.

Use node-root base (../../) for _meta-flow or _config-flow, since those mostly describe the node itself.

Would you like me to rewrite your Base-Relative IRIs description to capture this rule-of-thumb (namespace-root for cross-node data, node-root for self-descriptive metadata)?

You said:
I decide to call them "intramesh identifiers":


Intramesh identifiers are like base-relative URIs (i.e., without the scheme, e.g., https:// or file://) except may not include fragments (#) or query separators (?). They correspond to the filesystem location of their corresponding resources. Intramesh identifiers are recorded within distributions and, where configuration is needed, under the node‚Äôs operational config flow. Paths are always resolved relative to the distribution file that declares them.

If it starts with a ../ it refers to the parent, ../../ refers to the grandparent, etc.

## Identifier Semantics

Identifiers have the same semantics as [[concept.url]]

## Identifier Name Limitations

- initial underscores prefix all reserved dataset identifiers and should be avoided in general
![[sflo#^pnoqpr3ff4za]] 

## Examples

Directory structure: node/flow/snapshot/distribution.trig

Operational config example: my-dataset/_config-operational-flow/_current/config.trig  
Inheritable config example: my-dataset/_config-inheritable-flow/_current/config.trig  
Meta-flow example: my-dataset/_meta-flow/_current/meta.trig

Intramesh identifiers from meta-flow distributions:

Node self-reference: "../../../my-dataset"  
Other flows: "../../_config-operational-flow/_current/config.trig", "../../_config-inheritable-flow/_current/config.trig", "../../_data-flow/_current/data.jsonld"  
Elements in other flows: Same pattern, just different flow names

--- but yes write me a doc on namespace-relative basing.
ChatGPT said:
Perfect ‚Äî I like intramesh identifiers as a project-specific term, since it makes clear: ‚Äúthese are inside the mesh, and they behave like relative IRIs but with conventions.‚Äù üëç

Here‚Äôs a doc-style write-up on namespace-relative basing, phrased to integrate with your terminology and conventions:

Namespace-Relative Basing
In Semantic Flow, distributions are often nested deeply inside a node‚Äôs flows (e.g., _data-flow/_current/...). If base IRIs are left implicit, relative identifiers would need multiple ../ steps to reach the node or its siblings. To simplify this, Semantic Flow recommends namespace-relative basing.

Concept
Every distribution file declares an explicit @base (in TriG/Turtle) or @context/@base (in JSON-LD).

Instead of using the document‚Äôs path as the base (the default in RDF), the base is set relative to the namespace root (one level above the node root).

This makes the namespace root the anchor, so that nodes can be referred to by simple <name> identifiers.

Path layout
namespace-root/
  djradon/
    _data-flow/_current/djradon.trig
    _meta-flow/_current/meta.trig
  another-node/
With namespace-relative basing
@base <../../../> .

<djradon> a :Node ;
  :hasMeta <djradon/_meta-flow/_current/meta.trig> ;
  :relatedTo <another-node> .
<> resolves to the namespace root (namespace-root/).

<djradon> resolves to the node (namespace-root/djradon/).

<another-node> is a sibling in the namespace.

Intra-node flows are reached with djradon/....

Advantages
Sibling references are short: <another-node> instead of climbing out with ../../../.

Node references are stable: <djradon> always means the node root, regardless of where the distribution lives.

Clarity: <> = namespace, <name> = node, <name/path> = subresources.

Comparison with Node-Relative Basing
Basing Style	@base value	<> =	<djradon> =	Best For‚Ä¶
Node-relative	../../	Node root	Child of node	Config/meta flows describing the node itself
Namespace-relative	../../../	Namespace root	Node root	Data/reference flows linking across nodes
Guidelines
data-flow and ref-flow distributions should use namespace-relative basing, since they often refer to siblings or other nodes.

meta-flow and config-flow distributions may use node-relative basing if they mostly describe the node itself.

Always set @base explicitly in every distribution to avoid fragile relative paths.

JSON-LD Example
{
  "@context": {
    "@base": "../../../"
  },
  "@id": "djradon",
  "@type": "Node",
  "hasMeta": "djradon/_meta-flow/_current/meta.trig",
  "relatedTo": "another-node"
}
‚úÖ With namespace-relative basing, intramesh identifiers remain short, predictable, and consistent across all distributions, while still resolving correctly to absolute IRIs.

Would you like me to also fold this into your Intramesh Identifiers doc ‚Äî i.e. add a subsection ‚ÄúBasing Rules‚Äù that distinguishes node-relative vs. namespace-relative, with the recommendation you just decided on?

You said:
Rats, shoulda thought this through more. But with only two node types, "namespace" and "data", we're obscuring the purpose of the non-namespace node. To be consistenty with RDF, you could call it a resource node, but that was a bit of a misnomer. It's a reference node, and reference nodes can have data flows. I'm even seeing a bit of the reasoning behind keeping separate _ref flows and _data flows... It's an IRI minter, and you might not have any data about a referencing IRI. (Which would make it a namespace node, which is not the right result.)

Discuss.
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 16s
Love this line of thought. You‚Äôve basically rediscovered a clean separation that the web/RDF world has had implicitly for ages:

Minting an IRI (naming) is different from

Saying anything about that IRI‚Äôs referent (describing) and also different from

Publishing data (datasets, distributions, versions)

Here‚Äôs a crisp way to reconcile your model with that‚Äîand keep your practical benefits.

1) Keep two node kinds (plus datasets as first‚Äëclass), but define them sharply
A. Namespace node

Purpose: folder/containment; does not denote a referent itself.

Allowed flows: none (optionally _catalog/site scaffolding if you have that concept).

Think: ‚Äúa shelf that holds many things,‚Äù not a thing.

B. Reference node (this is the ‚Äúthing‚Äù node)

Purpose: mints an IRI for a referent. May exist even with no data.

Allowed flows:

_ref-flow (recommended): identifiers, labels, sameAs, minimal identity/links. Can be empty.

_data-flow (optional): actual descriptive/assertional data about the referent; versionable, distributable.

_meta-flow (optional): about the node/packaging (provenance, authorship, build info).

_config-* (optional): operational/inheritable configs.

Key point: a reference node without _data-flow is still valid‚Äîyou‚Äôve minted an IRI and possibly provided just identity/links in _ref-flow. That avoids misclassifying it as a namespace.

C. Dataset node (separate first‚Äëclass object)

Purpose: publish datasets/distributions/versions.

Usually attached to a reference node or to the site, but remains its own ‚Äúthing‚Äù with DCAT/PAV/PROV semantics.

2) Why keep _ref-flow and _data-flow distinct?
Identity vs description: _ref-flow carries the bare minimum to situate the referent (labels, alt‚ÄëIRIs, exact matches) without implying canonical descriptive truth. _data-flow carries richer, possibly opinionated or evolving assertions.

Zero‚Äëdata minting: You can mint and index the IRI today (refs only), link it to external sources, and add data later‚Äîno structural churn.

Access/control: You might allow broader write access to _ref-flow (e.g., let curators add sameAs), while restricting _data-flow.

Versioning cadence: _data-flow often changes more and benefits from dataset‚Äëlike versioning; _ref-flow can be lightweight or even governed separately.

Caching & federation: Clients can crawl _ref-flow cheaply to map the graph of ‚Äúwhat exists‚Äù before pulling heavier data.

3) Basing policy (ties back to your ‚Äúintramesh identifiers‚Äù)
Use your term intramesh identifiers (path‚Äëlike, no ? or #), and set the base explicitly in each distribution.

Rule of thumb

Across nodes (most common in _data-flow and _ref-flow):
Use namespace‚Äërelative basing ‚Üí @base <../../../>

<> = namespace root

<djradon> = the node

<sibling-node/...> = clean sibling refs

Inside the node (self‚Äëdescriptive meta/config):
Use node‚Äërelative basing ‚Üí @base <../../>

<> = the node

_meta-flow/..., _config-.../... etc. stay short

(You can standardize this in docs so authors don‚Äôt have to think about ../ math.)

4) Minimal semantics for each flow
_ref-flow (identity layer):

Required? No (but recommended to exist, even if empty stub).

Typical contents: rdfs:label, skos:prefLabel, skos:exactMatch/owl:sameAs, schema:identifier, external IDs, a canonical @id statement if helpful, maybe a pointer to ‚Äúprimary data‚Äù (sflow:primaryData ‚Üí _data-flow/_current/...).

_data-flow (assertional layer):

Required? No.

Typical contents: core descriptive triples about the referent; can be arranged as dataset/distributions if you like fine‚Äëgrained versioning.

_meta-flow (about the package):

Provenance, authorship, generation timestamps, build hashes, PAV/PROV.

_config-* (ops/inheritance):

Operational behavior, import policies, basing presets, validation profiles, etc.

5) Lifecycle & invariants (easy to enforce with SHACL)
A namespace node MUST NOT have _ref-flow or _data-flow.

A reference node MAY have _ref-flow and/or _data-flow; both OPTIONAL.

A dataset node SHOULD declare DCAT/PAV/PROV and manage _dist artifacts; you can keep your _current/version series pattern.

(If useful, I can draft tiny SHACL shapes to enforce these.)

6) Folder examples with basing
ref-flow example (namespace‚Äërelative):

# namespace-root/djradon/_ref-flow/_current/ref.trig
@base <../../../> .

<djradon>
  rdfs:label "DJ Radon"@en ;
  skos:exactMatch <https://wikidata.org/entity/Q123456> ;
  sflow:primaryData <djradon/_data-flow/_current/data.jsonld> .
data-flow example (namespace‚Äërelative):

# namespace-root/djradon/_data-flow/_current/data.trig
@base <../../../> .

<djradon>
  a :Person ;
  :worksFor <flux-tailor> ;
  :sameAs <https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0000> .
meta-flow example (node‚Äërelative):

# namespace-root/djradon/_meta-flow/_current/meta.trig
@base <../../> .

<> pav:createdOn "2025-08-20T12:34:56Z"^^xsd:dateTime ;
   pav:createdBy <https://github.com/djradon> ;
   sflow:buildHash "abc123" .
7) Naming sanity check
Namespace node = container; not a referent.

Reference node = the ‚Äúthing‚Äù node; mints an IRI; can be ref‚Äëonly or ref+data.

Dataset node = publishing unit (optional, but first‚Äëclass).

If you ever want a more ‚Äúfaceted‚Äù framing (fits your relator/facet thinking): treat ‚Äúminting‚Äù, ‚Äúidentity‚Äù, ‚Äúassertional data‚Äù, and ‚Äúpublication‚Äù as facets that a node may have; the presence of _ref-flow/_data-flow/_meta-flow/DCAT distributions signals which facets are active.

If this resonates, I can fold these decisions into concise spec text (terminology + basing rules + flow contracts), and/or draft SHACL to validate node types and flow presence.

You said:
You could almost put all of the _ref-flow data in the _meta-flow. Arguably alt-IRIs is more metadata. 

The guideline for "what's in _meta-flow" is stuff that refers to the node-as-node, ie., uses the _node-handle. But it is clear to me now, you might want to hand a dataset in the mesh, and not pollute it with naming info. But yes, for datasets, you might not want to capture provenance within the dataset. So you could provenance (stuff about the dataset, not stuff about the dataset-as-node) in _ref-flow.
ChatGPT said:
Totally‚Äîthis is the right nuance. Here‚Äôs a tidy way to draw the line so authors don‚Äôt have to think too hard each time.

Simple decision rules
1) The subject test
If the primary subject is the node-as-node (your _node-handle, i.e., the thing in the mesh that has flows, build hashes, catalogs), it goes in _meta-flow.

If the primary subject is the referent IRI (the world-thing the node names), it goes in _ref-flow (identity) or _data-flow (description).

2) The travel test
If the statement should travel with the package regardless of where the node‚Äôs referent points (build info, authorship of the mesh artifact, publication timestamps, basing policy), put it in _meta-flow.

If the statement should travel with the referent (labels, exact matches, authoritative IDs), put it in _ref-flow.

If the statement is assertional knowledge about the referent (type, relations, attributes), put it in _data-flow.

3) Datasets special-case
Provenance about the dataset-as-publication (who generated this file, when, hash, pipeline): _meta-flow of the dataset node (or DCAT/PAV/PROV inside the dataset node).

Provenance about the dataset content (e.g., source of facts asserted about X): keep inside the dataset (e.g., named graphs with PROV), not in the node‚Äôs _meta-flow.

If you want lightweight, portable provenance pointers without touching the dataset (e.g., ‚Äúthis dataset synthesizes DOE + EIA‚Äù), you may place minimal references in _ref-flow of the dataset‚Äôs node, because they are identity/context for the dataset as a referent, not mesh packaging.

Dataset node split (provenance where?)

meta-flow (dataset-as-node artifact): who built, when, pipeline hash, mesh-level license.

Inside dataset (content provenance): PROV activities/agents for assertions, per-graph provenance, source citations.

ref-flow (dataset identity, optional): rdfs:label for dataset, dcat:landingPage, stable identifiers (DOI, etc.). Keep this light and non-assertional.

Optional guardrails (SHACL sketch)
Namespace node: MUST NOT have _ref-flow/_data-flow.

Reference node: MAY have _ref-flow and/or _data-flow; SHOULD have _meta-flow.

Dataset node: SHOULD include DCAT/PAV; MAY reference distributions; SHOULD have _meta-flow.

Why this pays off
Keeps naming (identity) clean and decoupled from description (data).

Lets you hand around datasets without accidentally dragging naming policy into them.

Gives you a place for portable provenance pointers without polluting content provenance.

If you want, I can formalize this into your spec pages (concise sections + predicate whitelists per flow + SHACL starter).

You said:
I'm not sure about "travel with the referent" vs "assertional knowledge". I'm thinking _data-flow only gets used when the referent is a dataset. In which case _ref-data contains type, relations, attributes, etc... it's data about the referent dataset of the same kind that would be there if the referent were a person. So provenance about the dataset-as-publication goes in ref. 
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 4 seconds
Got it ‚Äî let‚Äôs lock this in as a clean, minimal spec that matches your decision:

Mesh Node Model (lean version)
Node kinds
Namespace node: container only (no flows that assert facts).

Reference node: mints an IRI for a referent (person, org, place, or a dataset).

Dataset node: just a reference node whose referent is a dataset (so it follows the same flow rules below).

Flows (final meanings)
_meta-flow (node‚Äëas‚Äënode)

About the mesh artifact itself (the node package): build hash, createdBy/On, basing policy, licenses for the artifact site, catalogs, indices.

Subject is the node handle (<> with node‚Äërelative base).

Basing: @base <../../> (node‚Äëroot).

_ref-flow (identity + assertions about the referent)

The only place for semantic facts about the referent, regardless of what the referent is (person, org, dataset, etc.).

Includes: rdf:type, labels/aliases/IDs, relations, attributes, links, AND (when the referent is a dataset) the publication provenance (who published, when, version tags, DOI, landing page, DCAT/PAV ‚Äúabout the dataset as a published thing‚Äù).

Basing: @base <../../../> (namespace‚Äëroot), so <djradon> = the node; <sibling> = a sibling.

_data-flow (dataset content only)

Used only when the referent is a dataset. Holds the dataset‚Äôs content payload and/or its distributions, versions, graphs, etc.

It does not contain naming/identity or publication metadata; those stay in _ref-flow.

Content provenance (PROV for facts/graphs inside the dataset) lives inside _data-flow with the content it qualifies.

Basing: @base <../../../> (namespace‚Äëroot) for cross‚Äënode linking inside the dataset.

Intuition: _meta-flow = package/mesh bookkeeping; _ref-flow = truth about the thing you named; _data-flow = the dataset‚Äôs actual data (only exists if the thing you named is a dataset).

Intramesh identifiers (recap)
Project term for path‚Äëlike, base‚Äërelative identifiers without ? or #.

Always resolved relative to the file declaring them.

We standardize base:

_meta-flow: @base <../../> (node root).

_ref-flow and dataset _data-flow: @base <../../../> (namespace root).

Validation (light SHACL starters)
Namespace node

MUST NOT have _ref-flow or _data-flow.

Reference node

MAY have _meta-flow.

MUST have _ref-flow (if you want to enforce ‚Äúno nameless nodes‚Äù), else OPTIONAL.

If it has _data-flow, then _ref-flow MUST assert a dcat:Dataset.

Dataset node (i.e., reference node with a dcat:Dataset in _ref-flow)

SHOULD have _data-flow.

_ref-flow SHOULD contain publication metadata (PAV/DCAT).

_data-flow MAY contain PROV for content graphs.

(If you want, I can draft actual SHACL files with path checks for folder presence.)

Migration guidelines
Move all non-dataset assertions out of _data-flow ‚Üí into _ref-flow.

Datasets:

Keep identity + publication provenance in _ref-flow.

Put the payload (and content-level PROV) in _data-flow.

Add explicit @base to every distribution (../../ for _meta-flow, ../../../ for _ref-flow and dataset _data-flow).

Update your docs to say ‚Äúintramesh identifiers do not allow ? or #‚Äù.

Why this works well
One obvious place for truth about the referent (_ref-flow) regardless of type.

A dedicated place for actual dataset content (_data-flow) that you can version, shard, and sign independently.

Clean separation between package bookkeeping and semantics (_meta-flow vs _ref-flow).

Namespace‚Äërelative basing gives you <sibling> ergonomics where you need them most.

If you want, I‚Äôll fold this into your spec pages as a concise ‚ÄúFlows‚Äù chapter plus an ‚ÄúIntramesh identifiers & basing‚Äù appendix you can drop straight into the repo.

You said:
Yeah, pretty close. datasets can contain their own provenance or naming or whatever, many datasets do, and we take 'em all. But the person who creates the dataset node can still provide her own metadata (provenance, etc). You could even imagine situations where wholesale parts of the dataset get duplicated in _ref-flow. 

meta and metadata are fuzzyy terms. (I summarized a oerommons lesson as "3 types of metadata": structural, administrative, and descriptive, but those blend too. ) In a sense, _ref-flow might have descriptive metadata about the referent, whether dataset or not, at least in the conventional sense. But "metadata" is a false dichotomy. 

Thinking I should rename the "_meta-flow" to make it clearer that it's "node-as-node" data. maybe "_node-meta-flow" or even "_node-flow"
ChatGPT said:
Yes ‚Äî this clicks. You‚Äôve surfaced two tensions at once:

The word ‚Äúmetadata‚Äù is hopelessly overloaded. (structural vs admin vs descriptive, provenance vs catalog vs identity).

Your _meta-flow is special ‚Äî it‚Äôs not ‚Äúmetadata about the referent‚Äù but ‚Äúdata about the node-as-node (the mesh packaging artifact).‚Äù

That distinction is fundamental in your design:

_ref-flow = ‚Äúwhat the node names (the referent)‚Äù

_data-flow = ‚Äúthe dataset content if the referent is a dataset‚Äù

_meta-flow = ‚Äúwhat the node is (the mesh handle, build, provenance of the artifact itself)‚Äù

So calling it _meta-flow invites confusion with the conventional ‚Äúdescriptive metadata‚Äù bucket.

Rename options
_node-flow

Short, symmetrical with _ref-flow and _data-flow.

Emphasizes: this is about the node object itself, not the referent.

Pro: clean, minimal, no ‚Äúmeta‚Äù baggage.

Con: might feel too generic at first glance (‚Äúisn‚Äôt every flow a node flow?‚Äù).

_node-meta-flow

Still explicit: ‚Äúthis is the node‚Äôs own metadata.‚Äù

Keeps the ‚Äúmeta‚Äù hint, but scoped.

Pro: preserves continuity with _meta-flow docs.

Con: clunky; still inherits ‚Äúmetadata‚Äù ambiguity.

_handle-flow (or _node-handle-flow)

Leans into your existing terminology (‚Äú_node-handle‚Äù as subject for these statements).

Pro: sharp conceptual alignment ‚Äî data about the handle.

Con: more esoteric; might be harder for newcomers.

_package-flow

If you want to stress this is about the artifact package, not the thing described.

Pro: clearer for people outside RDF world.

Con: could be confused with dataset packaging.

My take
If you want the cleanest separation, I‚Äôd go with _node-flow.

Then your trio reads beautifully:

_node-flow (about the mesh node itself)

_ref-flow (about the referent the node names)

_data-flow (about the dataset content if the referent is a dataset)

That way you kill the ‚Äúmetadata‚Äù false dichotomy and the names themselves express the layers: node / ref / data.

Would you like me to rewrite your flows overview into this triad (node / ref / data), with _node-flow as the new canonical name, so you‚Äôve got a clean spec paragraph to drop into your docs?

You said:
yeah, _node-flow, I like. It also dovetails nicely with "the simplest node, the namespace node, doesn't refer to anything else, it just has an identifier. 

I'm debating whether to revert to the pre-"data-flow-only" docs commit, or just rewrite docs from scratch. I'm often tempted by "start fresh", and I definitely let AI-assisted documentation lead me to a place of "too much, too much repetition"
ChatGPT said:
That makes sense ‚Äî it sounds like you‚Äôve reached one of those ‚Äúreset moments‚Äù in a project where the vocabulary has just clarified itself (e.g. deciding _node-flow is the right term). That‚Äôs usually the best time to start fresh, because every old paragraph you patch has little traces of the old framing baked in.

Here are some framing thoughts that might help you decide between revert vs rewrite:

When to revert to a pre-commit
The old commit is close to the new model (just had the _meta-flow wording and maybe the ‚Äúdata-flow-only‚Äù detour).

You‚Äôd only need surgical edits to terminology and a couple of examples.

You want to preserve the evolution trail in Git, showing how ‚Äúdata-flow-only‚Äù was explored and then dropped.

When to rewrite from scratch
The old text is structurally weighed down: too many repetitions, too many parallel examples, too much AI verbosity.

You want a crisp, small core doc that names each flow once, defines it, and then shows 1 example.

You want to rethink order of exposition: e.g. start with the minimal node ‚Üí build up (namespace node ‚Üí reference node ‚Üí dataset node), rather than a soup of flows.

You want new docs to reflect your current clarity (node/ref/data) without legacy cruft.

Suggested outline if you start fresh
Mesh Node Types

Namespace node (simplest: just identifier, only _node-flow)

Reference node (minted IRI, _ref-flow mandatory, _node-flow optional)

Dataset node (reference node where referent is a dataset; adds _data-flow)

Flows

_node-flow ‚Üí node-as-node, mesh artifact

_ref-flow ‚Üí referent identity + assertions

_data-flow ‚Üí dataset content (only if referent is dataset)

Basing

_node-flow: node-relative (../../)

_ref-flow & _data-flow: namespace-relative (../../../)

Intramesh identifiers

Short definition + examples

Canonical examples

Person node (namespace + reference)

Dataset node (with all three flows)

Strategy
If you want to keep Git history clean ‚Üí revert and apply surgical rename/refactor.

If you want to set a new baseline spec that‚Äôs lean and expressive ‚Üí start fresh and replace.
(You can always keep the ‚Äútoo much repetition‚Äù version in Git as a branch, so the exploration isn‚Äôt lost.)

Want me to sketch a fresh minimal doc in that outline (1‚Äì2 pages, no repetition, clear examples), so you can see what ‚Äústart fresh‚Äù would actually look like before deciding?

You said:
Uploaded image
I've been doing the docs as a dendron wiki. Currently 115 documentation files:

Sounds crazy now that I say it. But having a separate doc/note or each "named thing" is I find very helpful for looking up terminology AND for refactoring names.
ChatGPT said:
Not crazy at all ‚Äî that‚Äôs a very Dendron-ish superpower. One file per ‚Äúnamed thing‚Äù gives you:

üîé Indexability: you can jump to concept.mesh.resource.element.handle.md and know exactly where that term is defined.

ü™∂ Refactorability: rename a concept and the file name itself changes, so your vocabulary shifts stay explicit.

üß© Granularity: it‚Äôs easier to delete/merge/supersede small notes than to extract definitions from a monolith.

üìö Cross-linking: Dendron backlinks give you instant maps of ‚Äúwho references this term.‚Äù

Yes, you‚Äôve now got 115 files, but that‚Äôs because your conceptual surface area really is that wide. It‚Äôs just visible now instead of hidden inside paragraphs.

Where it can get ‚Äútoo much‚Äù is narrative duplication:

Every small doc tries to re-explain the broader system in its own words.

Readers (including you six months later) end up skimming repetition.

That‚Äôs where a layered doc strategy helps:

Layer 1 ‚Äî Atomic notes (what you have now)
One file per named concept (concept.mesh.resource.folder._node-flow.md).

Minimal definition + link out.

No repetition of context, just a clean 2‚Äì5 sentences.

Example:

# _node-flow
A flow containing data about the node-as-node (mesh artifact).  
- Subject: the node handle (`<>`).  
- Base: `@base <../../>`.  
- Typical contents: build hash, creation info, catalogs.  
Layer 2 ‚Äî Guides / spec pages
A handful of overview documents (Flows, Node Types, Identifiers, Basing).

These pull together the atomic notes into narrative.

This is where examples and ‚Äúwhy‚Äù reasoning go.

Keep these <10 files total, so you‚Äôve got one place to maintain canonical exposition.

Layer 3 ‚Äî Reference / index
Dendron‚Äôs own graph or a generated index (e.g. ‚Äúall flow types‚Äù).

Useful for discovery, but auto-built so you don‚Äôt hand-duplicate.

So: your 115 atomic files are not wasted. They‚Äôre raw material. The move now is to stop trying to make each one a mini-essay and instead:

Prune them down to definitions.

Rewrite your flows + nodes docs fresh (using your new triad _node-flow, _ref-flow, _data-flow).

Let atomic notes serve as lookup stubs, not narrative.

Do you want me to sketch what a minimal atomic note template could look like (so each file stays 5 lines max), alongside an outline for a new Flows overview page that pulls them together?

You said:
data node contain a payload dataset and their intramesh identifiers (a base-relative IRI with no base) refer to that payload dataset in the abstract. The dataset is still contained in a particular kind of node flow, i.e., a data flow. All data flows also have identifiers. How is the data node referent different from the data flow's referent?
ChatGPT said:
Great, subtle question. Let‚Äôs unpack carefully using your current terms:

1. A data node
Referent: the dataset itself (abstract thing, possibly versioned, possibly with many distributions).

The node exists to mint an IRI for ‚Äúthis dataset.‚Äù

Example: <ns/rateplans> = ‚Äúthe URPX Rate Plans dataset.‚Äù

Payload is contained in _data-flow/ (its content, distributions, versions).

So the node referent = the dataset as a whole.

2. A data flow
A flow is a container of distributions about the node‚Äôs referent.

Referent: still the node‚Äôs referent (i.e., the dataset).

But: each flow sub-scopes how the referent is described.

_ref-flow ‚Üí identifiers, labels, provenance about dataset-as-referent.

_data-flow ‚Üí payload distributions (the dataset‚Äôs actual content).

_node-flow ‚Üí the node-as-node artifact.

So the flow itself does not mint a new referent‚Äîit inherits the node‚Äôs.
But: each distribution file inside a flow is a dataset in DCAT sense (with its own identifier).

3. Where the identifiers fit
Intramesh identifier for a node (e.g. <rateplans>) = the dataset referent itself.

Intramesh identifier for a flow (e.g. <rateplans/_data-flow/_current/data.trig>) = a distribution that describes or encodes that referent.

Difference:

Node referent = what the IRI stands for (the dataset).

Flow referent = a representation of that referent, i.e., data about the dataset (identity, content, or packaging).

4. Analogy (from RDF/DCAT)
dcat:Dataset = your data node referent.

dcat:Distribution = your flow distribution.

Both are ‚Äúabout the dataset,‚Äù but only the dataset is the canonical referent.

Flows/distributions are views/encodings.

5. So the short distinction
Data node referent: the dataset in the abstract.

Data flow referent: not a new thing ‚Äî it‚Äôs a channel for describing the same dataset (but can also be seen as a distribution about that dataset).

That‚Äôs why both need identifiers: the node identifier is the canonical IRI of the dataset, while each flow identifier is the IRI of a distribution that encodes/augments the dataset.

üëâ This distinction lets you, for example:

Cite <rateplans> in a paper (the dataset).

Cite <rateplans/_data-flow/_current/data.trig> in a provenance log (the particular encoding you used).

Would it help if I draft a diagram showing the relationship:

Node IRI (dataset referent) ‚Üí flows ‚Üí distributions,
so you can see clearly what mints an IRI for a thing vs for a representation?

You said:
close, it's not the IRI of a distribution, is the IRI of a flow. And the IRI of a snapshot refers to a particular Semantic Flow snapshot. 
ChatGPT said:
Ahhh, yes ‚Äî thank you for catching that. Let me re-draw this with your own layering:

1. Data Node
Referent: the dataset in the abstract (canonical ‚Äúthing‚Äù).

IRI: e.g. <rateplans>

A node can contain flows, each of which gives structured ‚Äúslices‚Äù of info about that same referent.

2. Flow (e.g. _data-flow/)
Referent: the flow itself, as a Semantic Flow construct.

In other words:

The node‚Äôs IRI (<rateplans>) = dataset referent.

The flow‚Äôs IRI (<rateplans/_data-flow>) = the data flow (the channel by which the dataset‚Äôs content is provided).

That‚Äôs why flows mint their own IRIs: they aren‚Äôt the dataset, they‚Äôre a structural part of the mesh that organizes how the dataset is published.

You‚Äôre right: these are not distributions in DCAT sense ‚Äî they are ‚Äúflow resources‚Äù in Semantic Flow.

3. Snapshot (e.g. _current/ or v1/)
Referent: a specific snapshot of the flow.

E.g. <rateplans/_data-flow/_current> or <rateplans/_data-flow/v1>

This is a Semantic Flow snapshot object: ‚Äúthe state of this flow at a point in the version line.‚Äù

That‚Äôs distinct again from the dataset referent itself, which remains <rateplans>.

4. Distribution files (inside a snapshot)
Finally, each file inside a snapshot (data.trig, data.jsonld) = a distribution in the DCAT sense.

These IRIs refer to concrete encodings of that snapshot.

So the chain looks like:
Node IRI: <rateplans> ‚Üí referent = dataset (abstract).

Flow IRI: <rateplans/_data-flow> ‚Üí referent = the data flow (Semantic Flow construct).

Snapshot IRI: <rateplans/_data-flow/v1> ‚Üí referent = a snapshot of the flow.

Distribution IRI: <rateplans/_data-flow/v1/data.trig> ‚Üí referent = an encoding of that snapshot.

Key distinction
Data node referent: the dataset (abstract, canonical).

Data flow referent: the flow (a channel within Semantic Flow).

Snapshot referent: a Semantic Flow snapshot (a concrete state of a flow).

Distribution referent: the file (a DCAT distribution of the snapshot).

That way you can say:

‚ÄúI used dataset <rateplans> in my work‚Äù (abstract).

‚ÄúSpecifically, I relied on snapshot <rateplans/_data-flow/v1>‚Äù (stateful).

‚ÄúIn its TriG distribution <rateplans/_data-flow/v1/data.trig>‚Äù (concrete encoding).

Would you like me to draw this as a layered hierarchy diagram (nodes ‚Üí flows ‚Üí snapshots ‚Üí distributions) with arrows showing which referent is which?

You said:
How Is a Flow Different from a Dataset Series? i.e., why invent this new term, when dcat already has an ontology that covers dataset versioning?
ChatGPT said:
Excellent, and you‚Äôre right to challenge this: DCAT already gives you Dataset / DatasetSeries / Distribution. Why not just map straight to that?

Here‚Äôs the distinction as I see it in your design:

1. DCAT Dataset Series
A dcat:DatasetSeries is a conceptual grouping of related datasets.

Example: ‚ÄúUS Census Data (2010‚Äì2020 releases)‚Äù

Each member dataset is a full dcat:Dataset (with metadata, distributions, etc.).

DCAT doesn‚Äôt prescribe filesystem structure; it‚Äôs about cataloging.

Key idea: DCAT is external-facing, descriptive, and consumer-oriented. It‚Äôs for data catalogs and discovery.

2. Semantic Flow Flow
A flow is not about versioning a dataset conceptually. It‚Äôs an internal mesh mechanism:

A flow is always scoped to a node.

A flow‚Äôs referent is the flow itself (a channel for info about that node).

A flow contains snapshots, each snapshot is a state of that flow at some point.

Each snapshot contains distributions (files).

So:

A flow is like a system partition of content (‚Äúnode-flow‚Äù, ‚Äúref-flow‚Äù, ‚Äúdata-flow‚Äù).

A snapshot is closer to a DCAT dataset.

A distribution inside a snapshot is exactly a DCAT distribution.

3. Why invent ‚ÄúFlow‚Äù instead of reusing DCAT?
Because DCAT doesn‚Äôt capture the node/mesh architecture you‚Äôre modeling. Specifically:

Flows are typed: _node-flow, _ref-flow, _data-flow. DCAT has no concept of ‚Äúfaceted channels‚Äù scoped to a node.

Flows exist even when no ‚Äúdataset‚Äù is being published: e.g., a person node has a _ref-flow, but its snapshots aren‚Äôt ‚Äúdatasets‚Äù in the DCAT sense. They‚Äôre lightweight identity packages.

Flows guarantee uniform filesystem semantics: every node can have flows, every flow can have snapshots, every snapshot can have distributions. This gives you structural regularity that DCAT never attempted.

Flows emphasize mesh internality: you want predictable resolution (../../_ref-flow/_current/ref.trig) rather than relying on a catalog record to point you to the right dataset/distribution.

4. Bridging to DCAT
You can (and probably should) map outward:

A flow snapshot (your _ref-flow/_current/ref.trig) ‚Üí dcat:Dataset

Its contained files ‚Üí dcat:Distribution

The sequence of snapshots ‚Üí dcat:DatasetSeries

But inside the mesh you need the stronger notion of flow as channel because:

Not every flow = dataset (meta flows, config flows).

You want a uniform handle for versioning any kind of node-scoped information, not just datasets.

5. The shortest answer
Dataset Series (DCAT) = semantic grouping of datasets for cataloging.

Flow (Semantic Flow) = structural channel in the mesh, scoped to a node, that can carry snapshots and distributions of any kind of node-related content (not just datasets).

Flows generalize DCAT‚Äôs pattern to all node facets, not just data publishing.

‚öñÔ∏è So: DCAT is for catalogs and external data consumers.
Flows are for uniform internal structuring of mesh nodes, with DCAT as an export/mapping target.

Do you want me to sketch a 2-column ‚ÄúFlow vs Dataset Series‚Äù comparison table you can drop into your docs so readers see at a glance why you need both terms?
