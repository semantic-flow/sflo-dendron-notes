# Description

The "Weave and Resource Page Generation" feature implements the core weave process responsible for managing resource facets, handling versioning and snapshots, and generating resource pages using templates. This process ensures local consistency within nodes by updating user and system resource facets, managing version metadata, and regenerating documentation resource pages. The weave process also supports interactive modes to improve data quality and includes meta-flow co-weaving to maintain accurate meta-flow states automatically.

# Problem Statement

Currently, the system lacks an automated, consistent process to manage resource facets, versioning, and resource page generation within nodes. This results in potential inconsistencies, outdated resource pages, and manual overhead in maintaining meta-flow states. There is a need to implement a robust weave process that can target specific nodes, handle version snapshots, and generate resource pages efficiently and accurately.

# Objectives

- Implement the weave process focusing initially on single node targeting.
- Manage system and user resource facets, ensuring required facets exist and are updated.
- Handle versioning and snapshot creation for changed user datasets.
- Generate resource pages using templates, with fallback to default templates if none are specified.
- Support interactive modes for data quality review and error detection.
- Implement meta-flow co-weaving to keep meta-flow states consistent and up-to-date.
- Ensure file structure requirements are met for assets, templates, and CSS.

# Scope

- Focus on single node weave: updating all user flows within a single node, including their meta-flows.
- Exclude single-flow or recursive node tree weaving for initial implementation.
- Implement core features as described in the weave process documentation.
- Provide a foundation for future expansion to multi-node and tree-level weaving.

# Key Features to Implement

1. **Resource Facet Management**
   - Verify and create required system elements if missing.
   - Manage user flows, detecting changes that require version bumps.

2. **Version Handling and Snapshot Management**
   - Create new version snapshots for changed datasets when versioning is enabled.
   - Update version metadata accordingly.
   - Copy `_next` dataset to `_current` regardless of versioning status.
   - Flag unified datasets for regeneration.

3. **Resource Page Generation**
   - Generate documentation resource pages using specified templates.
   - Use default templates and CSS from root or node-specific `_assets` folders.
   - Handle missing templates by generating fallback default pages.

4. **File Structure Requirements**
   - Ensure presence of `_assets/_templates` and `_assets/_css` folders at root and node levels.
   - Manage node-specific assets and templates.

5. **Meta-Flow Co-Weaving**
   - Automatically update meta-flow whenever any flow in the node is woven.
   - Maintain local consistency without complex cross-node coordination.

# Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The weave process can be triggered for a single node, updating all user flows and meta-flows within that node.
- [ ] Required system resource facets are checked and created if missing.
- [ ] Changed user datasets trigger version snapshot creation and metadata updates when versioning is enabled.
- [ ] `_next` datasets are copied to `_current` for all updated flows.
- [ ] Unified datasets are flagged for regeneration after weaving.
- [ ] Resource pages are generated using templates, with fallback defaults if templates are missing.
- [ ] Interactive mode is available with at least a naive step-through option.
- [ ] Meta-flow co-weaving updates meta-flow states automatically and accurately.
- [ ] File structure requirements for assets, templates, and CSS are enforced and managed.
- [ ] The implementation is limited to single node targeting with no recursive or multi-node weaving.
- [ ] Documentation and code comments clearly explain the weave process and its components.

# Dependencies and Considerations

- The weave process depends on the presence of system and user resource facets as defined in the mesh resource facet documentation.
- Versioning features require version metadata management and snapshot creation capabilities.
- Template management relies on the in-memory service design for template usage calculation.
- Interactive mode may require integration with AI or user input mechanisms for metadata review.
- Meta-flow co-weaving assumes local consistency and does not currently handle complex cross-node locking or coordination.
- Future enhancements may include multi-node and recursive node tree weaving, as well as more sophisticated coordination mechanisms.

# Additional Notes

- The initial implementation should prioritize correctness and local consistency over performance optimizations.
- Consider extensibility for future interactive modes and AI-driven metadata validation.
- Ensure that the weave process can be integrated smoothly into the existing flow service infrastructure.

# Node Specifier and Routing Approach

To address the challenge of differentiating node paths from API endpoints and handling dynamic node hierarchies, the following approach will be adopted:

- Use a constant delimiter `API_IDENTIFIER_PATH_SEPARATOR` defined as `"~"` (in `flow-core/src/mesh-constants.ts`) to separate node segments in node specifiers instead of slashes.
- Node specifiers will explicitly include the root node, e.g., `"test-ns~djradon~weave"`, to ensure unambiguous identification.
- Node specifiers and names will be validated to allow only valid QName characters to prevent conflicts and ensure consistency.
- Routes will be registered using wildcard or parameterized routes that accept the full node specifier as a single string parameter.
- Parsing utilities will be implemented to split node specifiers into hierarchical segments internally as needed.
- Clear namespace separation between API endpoints and node specifiers will be maintained to avoid collisions.

# Implementation Plan

1. **Node Specifier Handling**
   - Define and use the `API_IDENTIFIER_PATH_SEPARATOR` constant for node specifiers.
   - Implement parsing and validation utilities for node specifiers ensuring valid QName characters.

2. **Route Design and Registration**
   - Create a new `routes/weave.ts` file exporting the route and handler separately.
   - Register routes that accept the full node specifier as a single parameter.
   - Implement route handlers that parse the node specifier and invoke the weave process for the targeted node.

3. **Weave Process Implementation**
   - Manage versioning, snapshot creation, metadata generation, and resource page generation as per the core weave process.
   - Support interactive modes in future iterations; initially focus on straightforward REST.

4. **File Structure and Asset Management**
   - createoptional  `_assets/_templates` and `_assets/_css` folders at root and node levels if configured

5. **Testing and Validation**
   - Write tests for node specifier parsing, route handling, and weave process correctness.
   - Validate route registration and node specifier scheme to avoid collisions and handle edge cases.

6. **Documentation and Comments**
   - Update documentation and code comments to explain the node specifier scheme, route design, and weave process components.

# Potential Issues and Considerations

- Handling invalid or malformed node specifiers with appropriate validation and error responses.
- Reserved characters or strings disallowed in node names to avoid conflicts with the delimiter or API routes.
- Future support for interactive modes and asynchronous operations.
- Performance considerations for weaving large nodes or datasets.

This plan aligns with the current project goals and constraints, focusing on correctness and maintainability while preparing for future enhancements.
