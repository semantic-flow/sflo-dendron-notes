- is user vs system really useful, at least at the folder level?

Task: Develop the Semantic Flow Ontology (sflo-ontology) as a Self-Hosting Mesh Repository

Context:
I've completed foundational work on the Semantic Flow mesh architecture, establishing a clean three-node model (namespace, reference, data nodes) with universal elements (_meta, _handle, _unified) and exclusive specialization elements (_ref, _data). All documentation has been updated to reflect this simplified, consistent model.

Objective:
Create the sflo-ontology that formally defines the Semantic Flow concepts, properties, and relationships. This ontology should be implemented as a self-hosting mesh repository, demonstrating the architecture in practice while providing the formal semantic foundation for the entire system.

Key Requirements:

Self-hosting implementation: The ontology should exist as a mesh-repo following the patterns defined in [[sflo.concept.mesh-repo]]
Comprehensive coverage: Define all core concepts from the mesh architecture (nodes, elements, datasets, handles, etc.)
Practical vocabulary: Include properties and classes needed for real mesh implementations
Architectural alignment: Reflect the three-node model and single referent principle

Starting Points:
Review the @/.ai-guidance.md and its two linked docs
Review [[sflo.concept.mesh-repo]] to understand the self-hosting approach
Consider how the ontology's own structure demonstrates mesh principles
Define core classes for MeshNode, Element, Dataset, and their relationships
Establish properties for versioning, handles, and metadata relationships
Create examples showing how real mesh instances would use the ontology
Success Criteria:
The ontology should serve as both the formal specification for Semantic Flow and a working example of a mesh repository, enabling others to understand and implement the architecture while providing the semantic foundation for tooling and validation.


I've documented @/sflo-dendron-notes/sflo.concept.mesh.resource.element.unified-node-distribution.md  which are different from @/sflo-dendron-notes/sflo.concept.mesh.resource.element.convenience-distribution.md 

Using convenience distributions, the URL https://semantic-flow.github.io/sflo-ontology/sflo-ontology.trig would return a trig distribution of the relevant dataset (either ref or, in the case of ontologies, data).
