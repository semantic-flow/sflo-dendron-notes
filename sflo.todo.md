## Immediately

- display absolute filesystem path for loaded 
- If the user attempts to create a node at a path that doesn't already exist, all the intervening nodes should be created as namepsace nodes.


meshes.ts
          "prov:startedAtTime": new Date().toISOString(),
          "prov:endedAtTime": new Date().toISOString(),

should we consider using the term names? capitalization might be an issue here:

    nodeType: z.enum(['Namespace', 'Reference', 'Dataset']).openapi({

file logging needs testing and write-access to logs directory

- read operations
- identifier-to-meta-relative-path utilities; really a whole bundle of functionality... where you can pass a "relativeTo" parameter. (mostly used for meta tho) in path_utils.ts
