reference nodes are the main semantic constituents of a [[sflow.mesh]]

Like all [[sflow.mesh.resource.node]], they have an [[sflow.mesh.resource.node-handle]]

The defining feature of a **semantic node** is that it has an associated [[sflow.mesh.resource.element.flow-dataset]]. It is a resource in the conventional RDF sense that it can be referred to in RDF data, i.e. as the subject or object of a triple.
